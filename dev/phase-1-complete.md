- [ ] Creative Center banner appears
- [ ] Banner can be dismissed
- [ ] "Open Inbox" button works
- [ ] Redirects to `/dashboard/inbox?type=creative`
- [ ] Banner reappears after page refresh (if not dismissed)

### Migration Testing (Staging)
- [ ] Run `npm run migrate:artifacts` (dry run)
- [ ] Verify output shows correct artifact counts
- [ ] Run `npm run migrate:artifacts:execute`
- [ ] Check Firestore for `artifacts` collection

## 🔧 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something breaks:

1. **Revert UI Changes**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD  # Reverts inbox CTA banner
   ```

2. **Migration is Safe**
   - Legacy collections unchanged
   - Only adds `_migrated` flag
   - Original data preserved

3. **Dual-Write Period**
   - Inbox still uses bridge to unified system
   - Legacy pages still work with old collections
   - No breaking changes
