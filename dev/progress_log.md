## Session: Fix Infinite Agent Handoff Loop & Secure Executive Boardroom
### Task ID
fix_infinite_handoff_loop_and_security

### Summary
Fixed an infinite loop where the system repeatedly handed off to the Linus agent when processing queries like "System health check". Additionally, hardened Executive Boardroom security to enforce role-based access control.

### Root Cause (Loop)
- In `actions.ts`, Linus was mapped to `executiveAgent` (generic Gemini-based)
- The `executiveAgent` could call `delegateTask` → `runAgentChat` → routing → causing a loop
- Linus should use `linusAgent` (Claude-based) with its own iteration limits

### Key Changes
*   **MOD**: `src/app/dashboard/ceo/agents/actions.ts`:
    - Added import for `linusAgent` from `@/server/agents/linus`
    - Changed `AGENT_MAP.linus` from `executiveAgent` to `linusAgent`
*   **MOD**: `src/server/agents/agent-definitions.ts`:
    - Updated Jack (CRO) roleRestrictions: `['guest']` → `['guest', 'customer', 'dispensary', 'brand']`
    - Updated Glenda (CMO) roleRestrictions: `['guest']` → `['guest', 'customer', 'dispensary', 'brand']`
*   **MOD**: `src/server/agents/agent-runner.ts`:
    - Added import for `canRoleAccessAgent` from agent-definitions
    - Added role access check before specialized agent handoff
    - Added security logging for blocked access attempts

### Security Summary
| Agent | Access |
|-------|--------|
| Leo, Linus, Mike, Roach, Jack, Glenda | Super Users Only |
| Ember, Drip, Pulse, Radar, etc. | Based on individual restrictions |

### Tests Run
*   `npm run check:types` (Passed ✅)
*   `npx jest tests/server/agents/repro_loop.test.ts` (2/2 Passed ✅)

### Related Docs
*   `.agent/prime.md` - Agent architecture reference
*   `.agent/refs/super-users.md` - Executive Boardroom protocol

### Result: ✅ Fixed & Secured
Linus now correctly uses Claude API and doesn't cause infinite delegation loops. Executive Boardroom agents are now properly restricted to Super Users only, with backend enforcement.

## Session: Onboarding Waterfall Data Hydration
### Task ID
onboarding_waterfall_hydration

### Summary
Implemented waterfall data hydration strategy to ensure dashboard has data ready on first login.

### Key Changes
*   **MOD**: `src/app/api/jobs/process/route.ts` - Enhanced `processProductSync` with 4-level waterfall:
    - Level 1: POS Sync (only if connected, skipped during onboarding)
    - Level 2: CannMenus (primary cannabis data source)
    - Level 3: Leafly via Apify (competitive intel fallback)
    - Level 4: Website Discover via Firecrawl (last resort scraping)
*   **NEW**: `processWebsiteDiscover` handler - Firecrawl integration for edge cases and manual entries.
*   **MOD**: `src/app/dashboard/settings/link/components/wiring-screen.tsx` - Updated log messages to show waterfall steps.

### Design Notes
- During onboarding, **POS is not connected**, so waterfall starts at CannMenus.
- After user connects POS from Dashboard, next sync will prioritize POS.
- This is the correct UX - don't add friction during onboarding.

### Commits
*   `5f5b49de`: feat: implement waterfall data hydration for onboarding (CannMenus -> Leafly -> Discover)

### Result: ✅ Complete
Waterfall data hydration implemented and pushed.

### Key Changes
*   **NEW**: `src/ai/claude.ts` - Claude service singleton with `executeWithTools()` agentic loop
*   **NEW**: `src/server/agents/tools/claude-tools.ts` - Tool conversion layer for Markitbot-to-Claude format
*   **MOD**: `src/ai/model-selector.ts` - Added `CLAUDE_TOOL_MODEL` and `isClaudePreferred()` helper
*   **MOD**: `src/server/agents/agent-runner.ts` - Added Claude routing branch for Super Users

### Features
- Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) for tool calling
- Agentic loop with automatic tool iteration until completion
- `shouldUseClaudeTools()` detection for action/integration patterns
- Automatic fallback to Gemini if Claude unavailable

### Tests
*   `tests/ai/claude.test.ts` - 7 passing unit tests

### Commits
*   `3de46a32`: feat(claude): integrate Claude for tool calling

## Session: 2025-12-28 (Deep Research Agent Wiring Fix)
### Task ID
deep-research-routing-001

### Summary
Fixed Deep Research agent routing in Agent Chat. When user selects "Deep Research" intelligence level from the model selector, it now properly routes to the Research Service instead of falling back to regular chat.

### Root Cause
1. `ThinkingLevel` type in `model-selector.ts` didn't include `'deep_research'`
2. `MODEL_CONFIGS` had no entry for `deep_research` 
3. `agent-runner.ts` had no routing logic to detect `deep_research` model level

### Key Changes
*   **MOD**: `src/ai/model-selector.ts`:
    - Added `'deep_research'` to `ThinkingLevel` type
    - Added `deep_research` config to `MODEL_CONFIGS` (uses Gemini 3 Pro + Max Thinking)
*   **MOD**: `src/server/agents/agent-runner.ts`:
    - Added Deep Research routing check in `runAgentCore()`
    - Routes to `createResearchTaskAction()` when `modelLevel === 'deep_research'`
    - Creates research task and returns user-friendly confirmation with task ID

### Flow
1. User selects "Deep Research" from model dropdown in Agent Chat
2. `runAgentChat()` dispatches job with `modelLevel: 'deep_research'`
3. `runAgentCore()` detects deep_research mode and routes to Research Service
4. Creates research task in Firestore `research_tasks` collection
5. Returns confirmation with task ID and link to Research Dashboard

### Tests Run
*   `npm run check:types` (Passed ✅)

### Commits
*   `ea00a91b`: fix(research): Wire Deep Research model level to Research Service

### Result: ✅ Complete
Deep Research now routes correctly from Agent Chat.

Fixed the Sora video generator which was using an incorrect API implementation. Rewrote the generator to use OpenAI's async job-based API flow with proper polling.

### Root Cause
- **Wrong endpoint**: Code was calling `https://api.openai.com/v1/videos` but should be `https://api.openai.com/v1/video/generations`
- **Synchronous assumption**: Code expected immediate video URL, but Sora uses async job workflow
- **Missing polling**: No logic to wait for job completion

### Key Changes
*   **MOD**: `src/ai/generators/sora.ts` - Complete rewrite with async job flow:
    - `createVideoJob()` - POSTs to create generation job
    - `pollForCompletion()` - Polls until completed/failed
    - Configurable poll interval for testing
*   **MOD**: `src/ai/flows/generate-video.ts` - Enhanced error logging
*   **MOD**: `tests/ai/sora-generator.test.ts` - Updated tests for async flow (8 tests)

### Tests Run
*   `npm test -- tests/ai/sora-generator.test.ts` (8/8 Passed ✅)

### Additional Fixes (Same Session)
*   **MOD**: Updated Veo model from deprecated `veo-3.0-generate-001` to `veo-3.1-generate-preview`
*   Commit: `6e9a7ead` - "fix(video): update Veo model to veo-3.1-generate-preview (3.0 deprecated)"

### Sora Video Pipeline Complete Rewrite (Session 2)
*   **Root Cause Discovery**: OpenAI Sora API requires 3-step flow: Create job → Poll → Download from `/content` endpoint
*   **Fix 1**: Corrected endpoint from `/v1/video/generations` to `/v1/videos`
*   **Fix 2**: Added `queued` and `in_progress` as valid polling statuses  
*   **Fix 3**: Implemented video download from `/v1/videos/{id}/content` endpoint
*   **Fix 4**: Upload to Firebase Storage with explicit bucket name
*   **Tests**: 10 comprehensive unit tests covering full flow
*   Commits: `e3dbe715`, `57f04ee1`, `c43846cf`, `f2490c71`, `326ece62`

### Notes
*   The Sora API may still be in limited preview - if 403/404 occurs, error will now be clearly logged instead of silently falling back
*   Veo (Google) may also need verification once API access is confirmed

## Session: 2025-12-24 (Dashboard & Knowledge Base Fixes)
### Task ID
fix-firestore-indexes-001

### Summary
Fixed 500 errors on CEO dashboard Knowledge Base tab and data_jobs listener by adding missing Firestore composite indexes.

### Key Changes
*   **Firestore Indexes:** Added 3 composite indexes to `firestore.indexes.json`:
    *   `knowledge_bases`: (ownerId + createdAt DESC) - for `getKnowledgeBasesAction`
    *   `knowledge_bases`: (ownerType + enabled + createdAt DESC) - for `getSystemKnowledgeBasesAction`
    *   `data_jobs`: (userId + createdAt DESC) - for data job listener
*   **KB Schema:** Added `UpdateKnowledgeBaseSchema` for system instructions

### Root Cause Analysis
*   `/dashboard/ceo?tab=knowledge-base` 500 errors: Query uses `.where('ownerId', '==', ownerId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')` which requires a composite index
*   `data_jobs` listener errors: Query uses `.where('userId', '==', userId).orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')` which requires a composite index
*   POST /dashboard 500 errors: Server actions calling `requireUser()` before auth completes - expected behavior with graceful error handling

### Commits
*   `8640d814`: fix(indexes): add composite indexes for knowledge_bases and data_jobs collections
*   `26bb7008`: feat(kb): add UpdateKnowledgeBaseSchema for system instructions

### Deployment Required
*   Run: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
*   Wait 2-3 minutes for indexes to build
*   Then verify Knowledge Base tab loads without 500 errors

## Session: Fix Build - Server Actions Error
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Task ID:** BUILD-FIX-SERVER-ACTIONS-001

### Summary
Fixed critical build errors where `src/server/integrations/gmail/oauth.ts` and `src/server/utils/secrets.ts` were incorrectly marked with `'use server'`, causing the build to fail because they exported synchronous functions which Next.js treats as invalid Server Actions.

*   Removed `'use server'` from `src/server/utils/secrets.ts`.

## Session: Brand Page Name Fix
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Task ID:** BRAND-PAGE-FIX-001

### Summary
Fixed an issue where the Brand Page dashboard would show "Unknown Brand" for newly onboarded brands because the `brands` document hadn't been created yet (sync job pending), while the name was actually stored in the `organizations` collection.

### Key Changes
*   **Fallback Logic:** Updated `src/app/dashboard/content/brand-page/page.tsx` to check the `organizations` collection for the brand/entity name if the main `brands` document is missing.
*   **One-Time Edit:** Relaxed the `canEditName` logic to allow editing as long as `nameSetByUser` is not true, instead of requiring the name to be strictly "Unknown". This allows users to correct the name once after onboarding.

### Tests Run
*   `npm run check:types` (Passed)

### Key Changes
*   **Auto-detect User ID:** Updated `src/components/dashboard/data-import-dropdown.tsx` to use the `useUser` hook to retrieve the current user's ID if one isn't passed via props. This ensures the component correctly subscribes to `data_jobs` in Firestore.

### Tests Run

-   **CRM Sync**: Updated `seedSeoPageAction` to automatically add discovered retailers to the Super User CRM (`organizations` collection) as "unclaimed".
-   **Claim Backend**: Updated `createClaimSubscription` to support linking new claims to existing Organizations and handling Free Plans correctly.
-   **Claim Frontend**: Updated `/claim` page to support `orgId` parameter (pre-fill/lock business name) and added "Free Listing" flow.
-   **Tests**: Added `tests/server/actions/claim-flow.test.ts` verifying CRM linking and Free/Paid flows.

### Result: ✅ Complete
Discovered entities now appear in the CRM and can be claimed using the `/claim?orgId=[id]` link.

### Update: Lead Generation & Capture
Implemented lead capture on public pages:
-   **Component**: Created `LeadCaptureForm` for collecting visitor inquiries.
-   **Pages**: Injected form into **Brand Page** (Footer) and **Dispensary Page** (Sidebar).
-   **Integration**: Leads are saved to `leads` collection with correct `orgId` linking (handling `disp_` prefix for dispensaries).
-   **Tests**: Added `tests/server/actions/leads.test.ts` to verify data capture.

### Result: ✅ Complete
Visitors can now contact brands/dispensaries directly from their pages, generating leads for the dashboard.

### Update: Foot Traffic Control Center Optimization
Refactored the CEO Dashboard tool for generating SEO pages to address user feedback ("overengineered", "fails"):
-   **Architecture**: Simplified `FootTrafficTab` to focus on Page Management (`zip` and `brand` pages) instead of Geo Zones/Alerts.
-   **New Feature**: Added `QuickGeneratorDialog` for batch-creating ZIP pages using a simple list input (no CSV needed).
-   **Reliability**: Hardened `seedSeoPageAction` to wrap product discovery in try/catch, ensuring page generation succeeds (with empty products) even if local product discovery fails or times out.
-   **UX**: Moved "Create Brand Page" and "Quick Generate ZIPs" to top-level buttons.

### Result: ✅ Complete
The Control Center is now a focused "Page Factory" that allows reliable bulk generation.

## Session: 2026-01-18 (08:30 UTC) - Production Ready Brand Role (Part 2)

### Summary
Completed the integration of competitive intelligence discovery into the onboarding and settings flows, along with comprehensive unit testing and environment hardening.

### Achievements
- **Competitor Onboarding Selection**: Integrated a dedicated step in `onboarding-client.tsx` allowing brands and dispensaries to manually select or discover competitors before finishing setup.
- **Slug Management Actions**: Created and verified `slug-management.ts` for URL-safe slug generation, availability checking, and reservation.
- **Brand Setup Enhancements**: Added vertically integrated toggle and real-time slug validation to `BrandSetupTab.tsx`.
- **Unit Testing**:
    - `slug-management.test.ts`: 100% passing tests for slug logic.
    - `use-user-role.test.ts`: Verified `orgId` prioritization (currentOrgId > brandId > dispensaryId).
    - `setup-checklist.test.tsx`: Verified role-awareness and 5-item focused brand checklist.
    - `products/page.test.tsx`: Verified no demo data fallback for real users.
    - `dispensaries/page.test.tsx`: Verified graceful error handling for missing data.
    - Implemented UI mocks and environment polyfills to handle Radix/JSDOM/Genkit conflicts in Jest.
- **Technical Debt**: Removed redundant "Brand Identity" section from settings, unifying it with the Competitive Intel wizard.

### Verification Results
- **Automated**: `npm test -- src/server/actions/__tests__/slug-management.test.ts` passed.
- **Manual**: Onboarding flow updated to handle `selectedCompetitors` via Firestore batch writes.

### Result: ✅ Complete
The brand role is now production-ready with competitive intel integrated into the first-time user experience.
