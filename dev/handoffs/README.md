# Session Handoffs

This directory contains **session handoff documents** for work that needs continuation.

## Purpose
When an agent session ends mid-task, create a handoff here so the next agent can seamlessly pick up the work.

## Format
See `.agent/refs/session-handoff.md` for the full template and guidelines.

## Workflow

### Creating a Handoff
1. Use template from `refs/session-handoff.md`
2. Name file: `{feature-slug}.md`
3. Include: status, files changed, errors, pending tasks, next steps

### Resuming Work
1. Check this directory for pending handoffs
2. Read the handoff document
3. Continue work
4. Update or delete handoff when complete
