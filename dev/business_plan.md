# markitbot AI: Business Plan & Strategic Vision

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)
**Date:** January 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**markitbot AI** is the world's first **Agentic Commerce Operating System** for the cannabis industry. We are moving beyond static software (SaaS) to autonomous digital workers that actively drive revenue, retention, and compliance for brands and dispensaries.

Our "National Discovery Layer" strategy solves the industry's biggest problem—fragmented discovery—by mass-generating hyper-local SEO pages for every legal ZIP code, funneling high-intent organic traffic directly to operator menus. We monetize this value through a frictionless **"Claim Subscription"** model that ladders into a comprehensive enterprise automation suite.

**The Vision:** To build the "digital nervous system" of the cannabis supply chain, where AI agents handle the busywork of commerce so operators can focus on their craft.

## 2. Business Model Canvas

### Value Propositions
*   **For Brands:** "Be everywhere instantly." Automated national distribution visibility and d2c-style engagement without owning retail infrastructure.
*   **For Dispensaries:** "Your menu becomes your best salesperson." Automated price monitoring, customer retention, and inventory optimization.
*   **For Consumers:** "Find exactly what you want, where you are." Hyper-local, inventory-aware search that bypasses generic aggregators.

### Revenue Streams
1.  **Claim Pro Subscription (MRR Base)**
    *   **$99/month/location**
    *   **Value:** Verified badge, SEO control, basic analytics, lead capture.
    *   **Logic:** The "Volume Engine." Low barrier to entry, highly scalable.

2.  **Coverage Packs (Expansion MRR)**
    *   **+$49/mo** (100 ZIPs) / **+$149/mo** (500 ZIPs)
    *   **Value:** dominating search results in a wider geographic area.
    *   **Logic:** Monetizes the "National Brand" use case without complicating the base tier.

3.  **Growth & Scale Tiers (Upsell)**
    *   **$249 - $749/month**
    *   **Value:** Unlocks the full Agent Squad (Ember, Drip, Radar, Pulse) for deeper automation.
    *   **Logic:** The "Value Engine." Higher ARPU for sophisticated operators.

4.  **Enterprise / Empire**
    *   **Custom Pricing**
    *   **Value:** Custom integrations, white-labeling, multi-state data aggregation.

### Key Resources
*   **The Agent Squad:** Our proprietary AI personas (Ember, Drip, etc.) encoded with domain expertise.
*   **Data Moat:** The "National Discovery Layer" (thousands of SEO-indexed ZIP pages).
*   **Integration Layer:** Connectors to POS (Dutchie, Jane) and Menus (CannMenus).

## 3. Market Analysis

### The Problem: Fragmentation & Restrictions
*   **Advertising Ban:** Cannabis brands cannot use Google/Meta ads efficiently.
*   **SEO Desert:** Consumers search "dispensary near me" but find generic aggregators (Weedmaps) that rent traffic back to operators.
*   **Labor Crisis:** High turnover and compliance burdens make human staff expensive and inconsistent.

### The Solution: Agentic SEO & Operations
*   **Traffic Ownership:** We give the SEO equity back to the operator via their "Claimed Page".
*   **Digital Labor:** Our agents work 24/7/365, never call in sick, and scale infinitely.

### Target Markets
1.  **Track 1: Legal Cannabis (Adult-Use/Med)**
    *   **Focus:** Compliance-first local discovery.
    *   **Strategy:** ZIP-based "Where to Buy" pages hydrated with real-time menu data.

2.  **Track 2: Hemp / THCA**
    *   **Focus:** Nation-wide e-commerce.
    *   **Strategy:** Capture "legal buzz" search intent in non-rec states and route to compliant ship-to-home partners.
