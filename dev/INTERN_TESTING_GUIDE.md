## Overview

This guide covers testing two core features:
1. **Authorize.net Checkout** - Payment processing for subscriptions and hemp/accessory products
2. **Competitive Intelligence Playbook** - Auto-generated on brand/dispensary signup (their own "Radar")

---

## Part 1: Authorize.net Checkout Testing

### Background

Markitbot uses Authorize.net for credit card payments. Key rules:
- **Credit cards are ONLY for**: Hemp products, Accessories, Subscriptions
- **Cannabis products**: Use "Pay at Pickup" or "Smokey Pay" (CannPay)
- Cart with ANY cannabis disables credit card option

### Sandbox Test Cards

The following test cards work **only in sandbox mode**:

| Card Type | Test Number | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Visa** | `4242424242424242` | Most common test card |
| **Visa (Alt)** | `4007000000027` | Alternate visa test |
| **Mastercard** | `5424000000000015` | Standard mastercard |
| **American Express** | `370000000000002` | Use 4-digit CVV |
| **Discover** | `6011000000000012` | Standard discover |
| **JCB** | `3088000000000017` | JCB network |

### Test Card Details

For ALL test transactions, use:

```
Card Number:     4242424242424242 (or any from table above)

## Part 2: Competitive Intelligence Playbook

### The Vision: "Your Own Radar"

When a brand or dispensary signs up, they should automatically get their **own Radar** - a competitive intelligence agent that:
- Monitors competitor pricing
- Tracks market trends
- Delivers insights on a schedule
- Alerts them to pricing opportunities

### How Radar Works (Technical)

The Radar 3-Agent Pipeline:

```
[User Query] --> [Finder Agent] --> [Scraper Agent] --> [Analyzer Agent] --> [Insights]
                      |                   |                    |
                 Exa/Perplexity      Firecrawl/RTRVR      Claude Analysis
                 Web Search         Menu Extraction       Strategic Intel
```

**Stages:**
1. **Finder**: Discovers competitor URLs via web search
2. **Scraper**: Extracts product data from menu pages (auto-selects Firecrawl or RTRVR)
3. **Analyzer**: Generates strategic insights and pricing comparisons

### Competitive Intelligence Playbook Structure

When a brand/dispensary onboards, create this playbook:

```yaml
name: Competitive Intelligence Report
description: Weekly competitor monitoring powered by Radar

triggers:
  - type: schedule
    cron: "0 8 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 8 AM
  - type: event
    eventName: manual.competitive.scan

agent: ezal

steps:
  - action: ezal_pipeline
    task: Run competitive intelligence scan
    params:
      query: "{{brand.city}} {{brand.state}} cannabis dispensary"
      maxUrls: 10

  - action: generate
    agent: ezal
    task: Generate competitive intelligence report

  - action: send_email
    provider: mailjet
    subject: "Weekly Competitive Intel: {{brand.name}}"
    template: competitive_intel_report
```

### What Gets Auto-Generated on Signup

For **Brands**:
- Competitor tracking for their product category
- Price monitoring for similar brands in their distribution area
- Market trend reports

For **Dispensaries**:
- Local competitor pricing scans
- Nearby dispensary monitoring (within X miles)
- Daily deal tracking

### Implementation Location

The playbook should be created in `pilot-setup.ts` after user/org creation:

```typescript
// After creating brand/org in setupPilotCustomer():
await createCompetitiveIntelPlaybook(orgId, brandId, {
  city: config.type === 'dispensary' ? config.city : undefined,
  state: config.type === 'dispensary' ? config.state : undefined,
  brandName: config.type === 'brand' ? config.brandName : config.dispensaryName,
  scheduleFrequency: 'weekly',  // or 'daily' for premium plans
});
```

### Testing the CI Playbook

#### Test 9: Playbook Auto-Creation on Signup
1. Create a new test dispensary via pilot setup
2. Check Firestore `playbooks` collection
3. **Expected**: `playbook_{brandId}_competitive_intel` exists
4. Verify correct triggers and steps

#### Test 10: Manual CI Scan
1. Login as test brand/dispensary
2. Navigate to dashboard > Competitive Intelligence
3. Click "Run Scan Now"
4. **Expected**: Radar pipeline executes, results displayed

#### Test 11: Radar Pipeline Direct Test
```typescript
// Run in test environment or via API
import { runEzalPipeline } from '@/server/agents/ezal-team';

const result = await runEzalPipeline({
  tenantId: 'test-brand-123',
  query: 'Syracuse New York cannabis dispensary',
  maxUrls: 5,
});

console.log('URLs Found:', result.finderResult?.urls.length);
console.log('Products Scraped:', result.scraperResult?.totalProducts);
console.log('Insights:', result.analyzerResult?.insights);
```

#### Test 12: Quick Scan with Manual URLs
```typescript
import { quickScan } from '@/server/agents/ezal-team';

const result = await quickScan('test-brand-123', [
  'https://weedmaps.com/dispensaries/test-dispensary-1',
  'https://dutchie.com/embedded-menu/test-dispensary-2',
]);
```

### CI Report Content Verification

The generated report should include:

- [ ] Competitor names and locations
- [ ] Product categories found
- [ ] Price comparisons (if our prices available)
- [ ] Market positioning insights
- [ ] Actionable recommendations

### URL Filtering Verification

The URL filter (`url-filter.ts`) should block:
- Social media (reddit, twitter, facebook)
- News sites (hightimes.com/news, weedmaps.com/news)
- Review sites (yelp, tripadvisor)
- Generic blog content

**Test 13: URL Filter**
```typescript
import { filterUrls } from '@/server/agents/ezal-team';

const result = filterUrls([
  'https://example-dispensary.com/menu',     // Should PASS
  'https://reddit.com/r/cannabis',           // Should BLOCK
  'https://dutchie.com/store/test',          // Should PASS (platform)
  'https://hightimes.com/news/article',      // Should BLOCK
]);

console.log('Allowed:', result.allowed);
console.log('Blocked:', result.blocked);
```
