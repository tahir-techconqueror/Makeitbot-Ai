---

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Middleware Authentication Enforcement (FIXED)

**ISSUE**: Line 70 of `src/middleware.ts` had a hardcoded bypass:
```typescript
return NextResponse.next(); // TEMPORARY: Allow access for testing
```

**FIX APPLIED**:
```typescript
// Now enforces redirect to login
if (!sessionCookie && !activeSimulation) {
    const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
    url.pathname = loginUrl;
    url.searchParams.set('redirect', pathname);
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
}
```

**IMPACT**: Protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/onboarding`, `/account`) now redirect to login page instead of allowing unauthenticated access.

**REMAINING WORK**:
- [ ] Test redirect flow in dev/staging
- [ ] Verify session cookie validation works end-to-end
- [ ] Test x-simulated-role only works in development

---

### 2. ✅ Deprecated Client-Side Auth Stub (FIXED)

**ISSUE**: `src/lib/auth.ts` was a security risk:
- Dev bypass hardcoded
- No server-side validation
- Stub returned mock user data

**FIX APPLIED**:
- Removed `src/lib/auth.ts` completely
- Created deprecation notice: `src/lib/auth-deprecated.ts`
- Added logger alert: "Use requireUser() from src/server/auth/auth.ts instead"

**VERIFICATION**: All code still using `getCurrentUser()` will now:
1. Get `null` response
2. See deprecation warning in logs
3. Be forced to migrate to `requireUser()`

**REMAINING WORK**:
- [ ] Search codebase for remaining `getCurrentUser()` calls
- [ ] Migrate all client auth to server actions with `requireUser()`
- [ ] Remove localStorage-based role storage

---

### 3. ✅ CEO Dashboard Auth (PARTIALLY FIXED)

**ISSUE**: CEO dashboard relied on client-side localStorage for super admin access:
```typescript
// OLD: Allow CEO dashboard through - super admin auth handled client-side
if (isCeoDashboard) {
    return NextResponse.next();
}
```

**FIX APPLIED**:
```typescript
// NEW: CEO dashboard requires server-side role verification
if (isCeoDashboard) {
    if (!sessionCookie) {
        const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
        url.pathname = '/brand-login';
        url.searchParams.set('redirect', pathname);
        return NextResponse.redirect(url);
    }
    // Actual role verification happens in page component via requireUser(['owner'])
}
```

**REMAINING WORK**:
- [ ] Ensure `src/app/dashboard/ceo/page.tsx` calls `requireUser(['owner'])`
- [ ] Remove all localStorage role checks from CEO dashboard
- [ ] Add audit logging for super admin access

---

### 4. ✅ Extended State Compliance Rules (IMPLEMENTED)

**PREVIOUS STATUS**: Only 4 states implemented (IL, CA, CO, WA)

**CURRENT STATUS**: Now includes 14 states:
- ✅ CA, CO, WA, IL (original)
- ✅ NY, MA, ME, VT, CT (East Coast)
- ✅ MI, OH, MO (Midwest)
- ✅ NV (Southwest)

**ADDED CRITICAL LEGAL WARNING**:
```typescript
/**
 * ⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL NOTICE:
 * These rules are approximate and must be verified with legal counsel.
 * Cannabis regulations change frequently and vary significantly by state.
 */
```

**REMAINING WORK**:
- [ ] **LEGAL REVIEW**: Have cannabis attorney review all 14 state rules
- [ ] Verify current regulations from official state sources (rules may have changed)
- [ ] Expand to additional states based on business targets
- [ ] Implement quarterly regulation update process
- [ ] Add audit trail for compliance rule changes

---

### 5. ✅ Server-Side Age Verification (IMPLEMENTED)

**CREATED**: `src/server/actions/age-verification.ts`

**NEW CAPABILITIES**:
- Server-side age calculation from date of birth
- State-specific age requirement verification
- Structured logging for audit trail
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation

**USAGE PATTERN**:
```typescript
'use server';

export async function processCheckout(input) {
  // Verify age BEFORE processing payment
  await requireMinimumAge({
    dateOfBirth: input.dob,
    stateCode: input.state,
    userId: user.uid,
  });

  // Now safe to process payment
  return processPayment(...);
}
```

**REMAINING WORK**:
- [ ] Integrate into checkout flow
- [ ] Add audit logging to Firestore
- [ ] Test with various dates and states
- [ ] Verify cannot be bypassed with tampered requests

## How to Continue Fixing

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **RUN BUILD & TESTS**
   ```bash
   npm run check:all
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **AUDIT CONSOLE.LOG STATEMENTS**
   ```bash
   grep -r "console\.log" src/ | wc -l
   # Expected: ~386 statements
   # Replace with: logger.info(), logger.warn(), logger.error()
   ```

3. **LEGAL REVIEW SESSION**
   - Schedule cannabis attorney review of `src/lib/compliance/state-rules.ts`
   - Get written sign-off on compliance rules
   - Document any required modifications

4. **PAYMENT GATEWAY TESTING**
   - Update `.env` with production credentials (in secrets manager)
   - Run E2E checkout tests
   - Verify webhook signatures validate correctly

5. **API SECURITY AUDIT**
   - Manual review of all 47 routes in `src/app/api/`
   - Check each route for:
     - `requireUser()` calls
     - Input validation
     - Rate limiting
     - Error handling
