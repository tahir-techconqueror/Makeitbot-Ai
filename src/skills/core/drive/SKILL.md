# Drive Skill

## Capabilities
- **Upload File**: Save text content as a file in Google Drive (`drive.upload_file`).

## Usage
- Use when the user asks to "save this as a doc", "put this in drive", or "create a file".
- Often combined with other skills (e.g. "Generate a report and save it to Drive").

## Constraints
- Requires Google Drive integration to be connected.
- Currently supports creating new files (upload), not complex folder navigation.
