# Web Search Skill

## Capabilities
You have access to live Google Search results via `web.search`.
Use this to find:
- Real-time market data (competitor pricing, new product drops).
- Regulatory updates (news in a specific state).
- Business information (address, phone, hours).

## Best Practices
1. **Specific Queries**: Use specific keywords like "dispensary pricing Illinois 2024" rather than "cannabis prices".
2. **Citation**: When answering user questions with this data, always cite the source URL provided in the tool output.
3. **Privacy**: Do not search for PII or individual customer data.

## When NOT to use
- Do not use for "creative writing" or "internal data" lookup (use `docs.search` for that).
