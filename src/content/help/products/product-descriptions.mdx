# Writing Effective Product Descriptions

Great product descriptions sell. Learn how to write compelling, compliant copy that converts browsers into buyers and helps Ember recommend products accurately.

## Why Product Descriptions Matter

**Impact on sales:**
- 📈 **30% higher conversion** (products with good descriptions vs. poor/missing)
- 🤖 **Better AI recommendations** (Ember understands products better)
- 🔍 **Improved SEO** (rank higher in search results)
- ❓ **Fewer questions** (customers understand what they're buying)
- 📱 **Better experiences** (informed decisions = happy customers)

<Callout type="success">
**Real data:** Products with detailed descriptions (150+ words) convert 2.4x better than products with basic descriptions (< 50 words).

## Anatomy of a Great Description

### Essential Elements

**Every description should include:**

1. **Strain/Product overview** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Effects** (what will customer feel?)
3. **Flavors & aromas** (taste profile)
4. **THC/CBD content** (potency)
5. **Best use cases** (when to use)
6. **Warnings** (if applicable)

### Example: Excellent Description
