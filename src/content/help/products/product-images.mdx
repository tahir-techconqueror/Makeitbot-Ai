## Shooting Process

### Step 1: Prepare Product

- **45-degree** (shows depth)
- **Top-down** (flat lays)
- **Close-up** (details)

### Step 3: Capture Multiple Shots

**Take 5-10 photos per product:**

2. **Adjust exposure**
   - Increase if too dark
   - Decrease if too bright
   - Target: white background = pure white

3. **White balance**
