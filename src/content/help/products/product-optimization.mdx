# Product Search Optimization

Optimize your product listings so Ember (AI Budtender) and customers can find exactly what they need. Better data = better recommendations = more sales.

## Why Product Optimization Matters

**Ember is only as good as your product data.** When customers ask "What helps with sleep?" or "Show me Sativa under $30," Ember searches your catalog using:

- Product names
- Descriptions
- Effects tags
- Strain type
- THC/CBD levels
- Categories
- Price

**Better data = better matches = higher conversions.**

<Callout type="info">
**Real impact**: Brands with optimized product data see 40% higher chatbot conversion rates compared to those with minimal data.

## Essential Product Fields

### 1. Product Name ⭐ CRITICAL

**Good Names:**
- "Blue Dream 3.5g Flower - Sativa Hybrid"
- "Sour Diesel Live Resin Cart 1g"
- "Chill Gummies - 10mg THC - Indica"

**Bad Names:**
- "BD-3.5" (too vague)
- "SKU-12849" (meaningless to customers)
- "BLUE DREAM" (lacks context)

**Naming Best Practices:**
- Include strain/product name
- Add size/quantity
- Specify category (Flower, Vape, Edible)
- Include strain type if applicable (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)
- Keep under 60 characters

### 2. Description ⭐ CRITICAL

**Ember uses descriptions for semantic search.** Include:
- Effects (relaxing, energizing, focusing)
- Flavor profile (citrus, earthy, sweet)
- Experience level (beginner-friendly, experienced users)
- Use cases (daytime, nighttime, social)
- Unique features (organic, award-winning)

**Good Description:**
```
Blue Dream is a Sativa-dominant hybrid known for its balanced
effects of cerebral euphoria and full-body relaxation. Ideal
for daytime use, it offers a sweet berry aroma with earthy
undertones. Perfect for beginners and experienced users seeking
creativity and stress relief without heavy sedation.

Effects: Euphoric, Creative, Relaxed, Happy
Flavors: Berry, Sweet, Earthy
Best For: Stress relief, daytime use, socializing
```

**Bad Description:**
```
Blue Dream strain. Good quality.
```

### 3. Effects Tags ⭐ CRITICAL

Tag products with effects customers care about:

**Physical Effects:**
- Relaxed
- Energized
- Sleepy
- Pain Relief
- Focused

**Mental Effects:**
- Happy
- Euphoric
- Creative
- Uplifted
- Calm

**Use Cases:**
- Daytime
- Nighttime
- Social
- Active
- Meditative

**Example**: Blue Dream might have tags: [Happy, Creative, Relaxed, Uplifted, Daytime, Social]

### 4. Strain Type

- **Indica**: Relaxing, sedating, body high
- **Sativa**: Energizing, uplifting, cerebral
- **Hybrid**: Balanced effects (specify Indica-dominant or Sativa-dominant if known)

**Why it matters**: When customers say "I want an Indica," Ember filters by strain type.

### 5. THC & CBD Levels

Always include potency:
- **THC%**: e.g., 22.5%
- **CBD%**: e.g., 0.5%
- **Total Cannabinoids**: e.g., 24.3%

**Ranges are okay**: "18-22% THC" for flower

**Why it matters**:
- Beginners want low THC (5-15%)
- Experienced users want high THC (20%+)
- Medical users seek CBD ratios

### 6. Category

Accurate categorization helps Ember filter:
- Flower
- Vapes (Cartridges, Disposables, Pods)
- Edibles (Gummies, Chocolates, Beverages)
- Concentrates (Wax, Shatter, Live Resin)
- Tinctures
- Topicals
- Pre-Rolls
- Accessories

### 7. Price

- Always include current price
- Update when prices change
- Show discounts (was $40, now $35)

### 8. Images ⭐ IMPORTANT

High-quality product images:
- Clear, well-lit photos
- Show packaging and product
- Multiple angles if possible
- Minimum 800x800px resolution

**No image?** Markitbot uses category placeholders, but real photos convert 3x better.

## Optimization Checklist

Use this checklist for EVERY product:

- ✅ Clear, descriptive name (includes strain, size, type)
- ✅ Detailed description (100+ words, includes effects and flavors)
- ✅ 3-5 effect tags (Happy, Relaxed, Creative, etc.)
- ✅ Strain type (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)

## How Ember Uses Your Data

### Example Search: "Help me sleep"

**Ember's Process:**
1. Identifies intent: Sleep aid
2. Searches products with effects: [Sleepy, Relaxed, Calm]
3. Filters for strain type: Indica or Indica-dominant Hybrid
4. Looks for keywords in descriptions: "sleep," "nighttime," "sedating"
5. Ranks by relevance
6. Shows top 3-5 matches with explanations

**Good Data Example:**
```
Product: "Grandaddy Purple 3.5g - Indica Flower"
Effects: [Sleepy, Relaxed, Happy]
Description: "Known for its powerful sedative effects,
perfect for nighttime use and promoting deep sleep..."

Result: ✅ Ember recommends this as top match
```

**Bad Data Example:**
```
Product: "GDP-3.5"
Effects: []
Description: "Flower product"

Result: ❌ Ember doesn't find this or ranks it low
```

## Bulk Optimization

### For Large Catalogs (100+ products)

1. **Export → Optimize → Re-Import**
   - Go to Products → Export CSV
   - Add missing data in spreadsheet
   - Re-import with "Update existing" option

2. **Use Templates**
   - Create description template per category
   - Fill in strain-specific details
   - Faster than writing from scratch

3. **Prioritize Top Sellers**
   - Optimize your best-selling 20 products first
   - These get the most searches
   - Biggest impact on conversions

## Common Optimization Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Generic Descriptions
❌ "High-quality flower product"
✅ "Blue Dream is a Sativa-dominant hybrid offering balanced euphoria and relaxation. Sweet berry aroma, perfect for daytime stress relief."

### Mistake 2: Missing Effects
❌ No effects tagged
✅ 3-5 relevant effects from the list above

### Mistake 3: Vague Names
❌ "Vape Cart"
✅ "Sour Diesel Live Resin Cartridge 1g - Sativa"

### Mistake 4: Outdated Prices
❌ Price from 6 months ago
✅ Update prices weekly (or sync with POS)

### Mistake 5: No Images
❌ Placeholder image only
✅ Real product photo, multiple if possible

## SEO Benefits

**Optimized products also improve Google rankings:**

- **Rich product data** = better structured data
- **Detailed descriptions** = more keyword coverage
- **High-quality images** = image search visibility
- **Accurate categories** = better site architecture

Example: "Best Indica for sleep in Syracuse" → Your optimized Indica products rank higher

   - "Do you have Blue Dream?"
3. Check if Ember finds the right products
