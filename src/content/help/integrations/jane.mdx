## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Invalid API Key

**Symptoms:**
- "Authentication failed" error
- Products not syncing

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Typo in API key**
```
API keys are long and complex
Common mistakes:
- Missing characters
- Extra spaces
- Incomplete copy/paste

Fix: Copy entire key from Jane, paste carefully
```

**Cause 2: Wrong permissions**
```
In Jane: Settings → API Keys
Verify permissions include "Read Products"

If missing:
- Delete old key
- Create new key with correct permissions
```

**Cause 3: Key regenerated**
```
If you regenerated key in Jane:
- Old key no longer works
- Update in Markitbot with new key
```

### Issue 2: Products Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- New products in Jane don't appear in Markitbot

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Products inactive**
```
In Jane: Check product status
- Active products sync
- Archived products don't (unless enabled)
```

**Cause 2: Sync disabled**
```
Markitbot: Settings → POS
- Verify "Enable Sync" toggled ON
- Check last sync time
```

**Cause 3: Wrong Store ID**
```
If multi-store:
- Verify Store ID is correct
- Each store has unique ID
```

### Issue 3: Images Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- Products sync but no images

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: No images in Jane**
```
Not all products have images in Jane
- Check if image exists in Jane
- If not, add manually in Markitbot
```

**Cause 2: Image sync disabled**
```
Markitbot: Settings → POS → Sync Options
☑ Enable: "Sync product images"
```

**Cause 3: Image format issue**
```
Jane uses various image formats
Markitbot converts automatically
If issue persists, contact support
```

### Issue 4: Inventory Mismatches

**Symptoms:**
- Stock levels in Markitbot don't match Jane

**Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Sync lag**
```
If sync every 30 min:
- Order placed at 2:05pm
- Next sync at 2:30pm
- 25-minute lag is normal

Solution: Reduce sync frequency to 15 min
```

**Cause 2: Reserved inventory**
```
Jane shows:
- On Hand: 30 units
- Available: 25 units (5 reserved)

Markitbot syncs: 25 units (available only)

This is correct behavior
```

**Cause 3: Multiple sales channels**
```
If selling on:
- Jane marketplace
- Your website (Markitbot)
- Third-party (Weedmaps, etc.)

Inventory may lag between channels
Syncs catch up within sync interval
```

**For multiple Jane stores:**

**Each store:**
1. Separate Jane Store ID
