## How POS Integration Works

## POS Integration FAQs

**Q: Will this slow down my POS?**
A: No. Markitbot reads data via API, doesn't interact with your POS terminal.

**Q: Can I still manually add products?**
A: Yes! POS-synced and manual products coexist. Just avoid duplicates.

**Q: What if I switch POS systems?**
A: Disconnect old POS, connect new one. Products will sync from new system.

**Q: Do customers need POS accounts?**
A: No. Markitbot creates its own customer records. POS sync is just for products.

**Q: Is my POS data secure?**
A: Yes. Credentials are encrypted. We only read data, never write to your POS.

**Q: Can I sync multiple locations?**
A: Yes! Empire tier supports unlimited locations. Scout tier: 1 location.
