# Payment Processing Setup

Accept payments securely and stay compliant. Connect cannabis-friendly payment processors to enable online orders, subscriptions, and seamless checkout.

## Cannabis Payment Challenges

**Why payment processing is complicated:**

**Federal prohibition:**
- Cannabis is Schedule I federally
- Most banks/processors won't work with cannabis
- Visa/Mastercard officially prohibited
- PayPal, Venmo, Square ban cannabis

**State-legal conflict:**
- Legal in your state
- Illegal federally
- Banks follow federal law
- Limited payment options

<Callout type="warning">
**Choose carefully:** Using non-cannabis-friendly processors risks account termination and frozen funds. Only use processors that explicitly allow cannabis businesses.
