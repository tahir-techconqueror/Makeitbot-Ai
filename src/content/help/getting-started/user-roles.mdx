## Security Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
**Follow these security practices:**

1. **Minimum necessary access**: Give users only the permissions they need
2. **Regular audits**: Review user list quarterly, remove inactive users
3. **Strong passwords**: Enforce password requirements
4. **Two-factor authentication**: Enable 2FA for admins
5. **Offboarding**: Remove access immediately when employee leaves
</Callout>

### Password Requirements

**Markitbot requires:**
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character
- Cannot reuse last 5 passwords

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Enable 2FA:**

**Settings → Security → Two-Factor Authentication**

**Setup:**
1. Download authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
2. Scan QR code
3. Enter 6-digit code
4. Save backup codes

**Result:**
- Login requires password + 6-digit code
- More secure against account compromise

**Recommendation:** Require 2FA for all Super Admins and Brand Admins

## Multi-Location User Management

**For brands with multiple dispensaries:**

### Location-Specific Access

**Scenario: 3 locations**

```
Downtown Syracuse (Location A):
- Sarah (Dispensary Admin) - sees only Location A
- Mike (Dispensary Staff) - sees only Location A
- Jennifer (Dispensary Staff) - sees only Location A

North Syracuse (Location B):
- Tom (Dispensary Admin) - sees only Location B
- Lisa (Dispensary Staff) - sees only Location B

Westside Syracuse (Location C):
- Carlos (Dispensary Admin) - sees only Location C
- Emma (Dispensary Staff) - sees only Location C

Org-Wide:
- You (Super Admin) - sees all locations
- Amy (Brand Admin) - sees all locations
- David (Marketing Manager) - sees all locations (campaigns)
```

### Cross-Location Users

**Some users need access to multiple locations:**

**Settings → Team → [User] → Locations**

```
User: Tom Smith
Role: Dispensary Admin

Locations:
☑ Downtown Syracuse
☑ North Syracuse
☐ Westside Syracuse

Tom can now manage 2 locations.
```
