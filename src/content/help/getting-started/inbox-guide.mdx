# Navigating the Inbox

Your unified inbox is mission control for Markitbot. See all AI agent outputs, approve campaigns, review insights, and manage artifacts in one centralized location.

## What is the Inbox?

**Your inbox is where AI agents deliver:**
- Marketing campaigns (ready to approve)
- Competitive intelligence reports
- Product bundles and carousels
- Customer insights and analytics
- Compliance reviews
- Pricing recommendations
- SEO optimizations
- Event promotions

**Think of it as:** Your personal assistant's desk where they drop completed work for your review.

<Callout type="success">
**Average time saved:** 12 hours/week by having all agent outputs in one organized inbox vs. scattered across email, Slack, and spreadsheets.
</Callout>

- Click **[All]** filter to see everything
- Check **Archive** for accidentally dismissed items

### Issue: Can't approve campaign

3. Campaign has errors

**Solutions:**
- Check campaign status (may be "Sent")
- Verify your user role in Settings
- Open campaign to see error messages

### Issue: Too many notifications

**Solution:**
```
