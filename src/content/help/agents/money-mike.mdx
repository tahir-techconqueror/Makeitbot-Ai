Recommendation: Lower to $32
Confidence: 85%

Impact Forecast:

## Pricing Strategies

### Premium Strategy
**Best for**: Established brands, superior quality, loyal customers

**Ledger's Approach:**

### Value Strategy
**Best for**: New brands, high-volume focus, price-sensitive markets

**Ledger's Approach:**
- Price in bottom 30% of market
- Maximize volume and market share
- Accept thinner margins (30-35%)
- Compete aggressively on price

**Example:**
- Market Average: $30
- Your Price: $25 (-17%)
- Higher volume, 32% margins

### Match Market Strategy
**Best for**: Mid-market brands, competitive balance

**Ledger's Approach:**
- Stay within ±5% of market average
- Adjust based on quality and features
- Balance volume and margin
- React quickly to competitor moves

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Competitive Price Drop Response

**Scenario**: Competitor drops Blue Dream from $35 to $25

**Ledger's Alert:**
> 🚨 **Competitive Threat Detected**
>
> CompetitorX dropped Blue Dream 3.5g to $25 (-29%)
>
> Impact Forecast if you don't respond:
> - Volume: -40% (estimated)
> - Revenue: -$1,200/month
>
> Options:
> 1. **Match at $25** (protect volume, margin drops to 28%)
> 2. **Partial match at $29** (lose some volume, margin 38%)
> 3. **Hold at $35** (emphasize quality, accept volume loss)
>
> Recommendation: Partial match at $29
> Reasoning: Your brand has premium positioning. Full match signals price war. Partial match shows responsiveness while protecting brand.

**Action Taken**: Dropped to $29, added messaging "Premium indoor grown"

**Result**: Volume decreased only 15% (not 40%), maintained profitability

### Example 2: Inventory Optimization

**Scenario**: 45 units of "Wedding Cake" sitting for 75 days

**Ledger's Recommendation:**
> ⚠️ **Slow Mover Detected**
>
> Wedding Cake 3.5g (45 units, 75 days old)
> Risk: Product degradation, capital tied up
>
> Current Price: $32
> Current Margin: 47%
>
> Recommended Action: Flash Sale at $24 (-25%)
> - Min Margin: 33% (still profitable)
> - Goal: Clear 40+ units in 2 weeks
> - Revenue: $960 vs. $1,440 if full price (but unlikely)
>
> Alternative: Bundle with popular product at slight discount

**Action Taken**: Created bundle "Wedding Cake + Best Seller Vape" for $45 (15% off)

**Result**: Cleared 38 units in 10 days, introduced customers to complementary product

### Example 3: New Market Entry Pricing

**Scenario**: Launching in Massachusetts, need to price 127 products

**Ledger's Analysis:**
```
Massachusetts Market Analysis:

Average Margins: 42% (vs. 38% nationally)

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Test incrementally**: Don't change 100 prices at once. Test 10-20 products, measure impact, scale if successful.

**Protect margins**: Set minimum margins in dynamic pricing rules. Never go unprofitable.

**Communicate changes**: If raising prices, explain why (quality, demand, market conditions). If lowering, create urgency (limited time, sale event).

**Monitor competitors weekly**: Prices change fast in cannabis. Stay vigilant with Radar + Ledger.
