2. **Ember**: Starts recommending it to customers
3. **Drip**: Creates launch campaign with compliance-checked copy
4. **Sentinel**: Validates all marketing claims are legal

6. **Ledger**: Suggests optimal launch price
7. **Pulse**: Tracks campaign performance

All automatic. All working together.
