## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Focus on direct competitors**: Don't track everyone. Focus on 5-10 competitors who actually compete for your customers.

**Act on insights**: Intelligence is only valuable if you use it. Review weekly reports and take action.

**Combine with Drip**: When Radar finds a threat, ask Drip to create a counter-campaign.

**Track pricing trends**: Look for patterns, not just individual changes. Is the whole market dropping prices?
