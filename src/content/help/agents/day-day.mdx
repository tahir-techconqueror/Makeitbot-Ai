## SEO Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Patience is key**: SEO takes 3-6 months to show results. Keep creating content, optimizing pages, and building authority.

**Quality over quantity**: One great 1,500-word post beats ten thin 200-word posts.

**Mobile-first**: 70% of cannabis searches happen on mobile. Ensure your site works perfectly on phones.

**Local is critical**: "Cannabis near me" is the #1 search. Optimize for local pack rankings.
