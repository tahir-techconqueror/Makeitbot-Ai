## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Revenue Drop

**Question to Pulse:** "Why did revenue drop 18% last week?"

**Pulse' Analysis:**
```
Revenue Drop Analysis

Week of Jan 15: $10,450 (baseline)
Week of Jan 22: $8,570 (-18%)

Root Causes:

1. Out of Stock (40% of drop)
   - Blue Dream sold out on Jan 23
   - Lost estimated revenue: $1,200

2. Weather (30% of drop)
   - Snowstorm Jan 24-25
   - Delivery orders down 60%
   - Lost estimated revenue: $900

3. Competitor Promotion (20% of drop)
   - CompetitorX ran 30% off sale
   - Flower sales down 25%
   - Lost estimated revenue: $600

4. Normal Variance (10%)
   - Week-to-week fluctuation: $280

Recommendations:
1. Restock Blue Dream immediately (priority)
2. Monitor competitor promotions (Radar)
3. Weather delays are temporary (will bounce back)
```

**Outcome:** Restocked Blue Dream, ran counter-promotion, revenue recovered next week

### Example 2: Campaign Optimization

**Question:** "Which marketing channel should I invest more in?"

**Pulse' Answer:**
```
Channel ROI Analysis (Last 90 Days)

📧 Email (Mailjet):
- Spent: $960
- Revenue: $21,400
- ROAS: 22.3x
- CAC: $12
- Recommendation: ✅ Invest more (highest ROI)

📱 SMS (Blackleaf):
- Spent: $2,670
- Revenue: $28,900
- ROAS: 10.8x
- CAC: $18
- Recommendation: ✅ Maintain (strong performance)

📱 Social Media:
- Spent: $3,720
- Revenue: $14,200
- ROAS: 3.8x
- CAC: $45
- Recommendation: ⚠️ Optimize or reduce

💡 Strategy:
1. Double email spend (best ROAS)
2. Keep SMS at current level (solid)
3. Test different social approaches (ROAS too low)

Projected Impact:
- Shift $1,000 from Social to Email
- Expected additional revenue: $22,000
- Incremental profit: $8,800
```

### Example 3: Product Mix Optimization

**Question:** "Should I stock more flower or vapes?"

**Pulse' Analysis:**
```
Product Category Comparison

🌿 Flower:
- Revenue: $67,890 (48%)
- Margin: 41%
- Units: 2,340
- Inventory turns: 8x per year
- Days to sell: 45 days

💨 Vapes:
- Revenue: $42,650 (30%)
- Margin: 52%
- Units: 1,420
- Inventory turns: 12x per year
- Days to sell: 30 days

Profitability:
Flower: $67,890 × 41% = $27,835 gross profit
Vapes: $42,650 × 52% = $22,178 gross profit

Flower is more profitable in absolute terms,
but vapes turn faster and have higher margins.

Recommendation:
- Maintain flower variety (it's your top seller)
- Expand vape selection (+15%)
- Vapes require less capital (faster turns)
- Consider vape promotions to increase volume

Scenario: If you match flower revenue in vapes:
$67,890 × 52% = $35,303 gross profit (+59% over vapes)
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Check dashboards weekly**: Make it a habit. Every Monday, review key metrics with Pulse.

**Ask "why" questions**: Don't just see revenue dropped, ask Pulse why. Root cause analysis drives action.

**Track trends, not just snapshots**: One bad week isn't a pattern. Look at 30-60-90 day trends.

**Compare apples to apples**: Last week vs. same week last year (accounts for seasonality).
