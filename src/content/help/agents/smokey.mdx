# Ember - AI Budtender

Your 24/7 AI budtender that helps customers find products, answers questions, and routes orders - all while learning what works best for your brand.

## What Ember Does

**Ember is your digital budtender** that talks to customers on your brand page. Think of Ember as your best budtender who:
- Never takes a break (available 24/7)
- Knows every product in your catalog
- Remembers customer preferences
- Routes orders to nearby dispensaries
- Learns from every conversation

## Key Features

### Product Recommendations
Ember helps customers find products based on:
- **Effects** they want (relaxation, energy, focus, sleep, etc.)
- **Experience level** (new user, occasional, daily)
- **Consumption method** (flower, vapes, edibles, etc.)
- **THC/CBD preferences**
- **Price range**
- **Past purchases** (if customer is logged in)

### Product Knowledge
Ember can explain:
- Strain types (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)
- Cannabinoid profiles (THC, CBD, CBG, etc.)
- Terpene effects
- Dosing guidance
- Consumption methods

### Order Routing
When customers want to buy:
1. Ember shows nearby dispensaries with the product in stock
2. Customer selects a dispensary
3. Order gets routed to that location
4. You stay in control of the customer relationship

<Callout type="success">
**The key difference:** Unlike marketplaces (Weedmaps, Leafly), customers stay in YOUR funnel. You own the relationship. Dispensaries are fulfillment partners, not competitors for your customer.
</Callout>
