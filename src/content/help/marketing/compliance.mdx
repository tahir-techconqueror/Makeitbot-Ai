# Cannabis Marketing Compliance

Navigate cannabis advertising regulations confidently. Learn what you can and can't say, how to stay compliant across channels, and how Sentinel helps protect your brand.

## Why Compliance Matters

**Cannabis marketing is heavily regulated:**
- 🚨 **Fines** - Violations can cost $10,000-$100,000+ per incident
- 📵 **Account bans** - Social media, email platforms ban non-compliant brands
- ⚖️ **License risk** - Serious violations can jeopardize your cannabis license
- 💔 **Brand damage** - Public violations harm reputation
- 🛡️ **Consumer protection** - Regulations protect public health

<Callout type="warning">
**Compliance is not optional.** Every state has different rules, and federal restrictions still apply. Sentinel (your compliance agent) helps, but you're ultimately responsible.
