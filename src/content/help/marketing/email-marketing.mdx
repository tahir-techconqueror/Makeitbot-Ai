# Email Marketing with Mailjet

Master email marketing for cannabis brands using Markitbot's Mailjet integration. Build relationships, nurture leads, and drive sales through high-converting email campaigns.

## Why Email for Cannabis?

Email is essential for cannabis marketing:

| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Owned Audience** | Not reliant on social media algorithms |
| **High ROI** | $36 return for every $1 spent (avg) |
| **Detailed Content** | Room for stories, education, full product info |
| **Segmentation** | Target specific customer groups precisely |
| **Automation** | Welcome series, abandoned carts, re-engagement |

<Callout type="info">
**Email builds relationships:** While SMS is great for immediate action, email nurtures long-term customer relationships through education, storytelling, and value.

## Email Design Best Practices

### Template Structure

**Recommended Layout:**
```
[Pre-header Text (50-100 chars)]

[Header: Logo + navigation]

[Hero Image (600-800px wide)]

[Headline (H1)]

[Body Copy (2-4 paragraphs)]

[Product Grid or CTA Button]

[Secondary Content (optional)]

[Footer: Social links, unsubscribe, address]
```

### Mobile Optimization

**Critical:** 60%+ of emails opened on mobile

✅ **Do:**
- Single column layout
- Large, tappable buttons (44px min)
- Text: 14px+ font size
- Subject line: <50 characters
- Pre-header text visible

❌ **Don't:**
- Multi-column layouts (hard to read on mobile)
- Tiny text or buttons
- Image-only emails (may not load)

### Subject Line Best Practices

**Length:** 40-50 characters (shorter on mobile)

**Tactics:**
- **Urgency:** "Ends Tonight", "Last Chance", "24 Hours Only"
- **Personalization:** "Hi [FirstName]", "Your Favorites Are Back"
- **Curiosity:** "You Won't Believe This New Strain", "The Secret to Better Sleep"
- **Value:** "Save 25%", "Free Gift Inside", "Exclusive Access"
- **Emojis:** 🔥 🌿 💚 (1-2 max, relevant)

**A/B Test:**
- Test 2 subject lines on 20% of audience
- Send winning version to remaining 80%

**Examples:**

| Good ✅ | Bad ❌ |
|---------|--------|
| "🔥 Flash Sale: 25% Off (Ends Tonight!)" | "Check Out Our Sale" |
| "Your Exclusive 20% Off Code Inside" | "Newsletter #47" |
| "New Strain Alert: Purple Punch is Here!" | "Product Update" |
