# Creating Marketing Campaigns

Launch SMS, email, and social media campaigns with Drip (Marketing Automation Agent). From planning to execution in minutes, not hours.

## Campaign Types

Markitbot supports three campaign channels:

| Channel | Best For | Engagement Rate | Cost |
|---------|----------|-----------------|------|
| **SMS** | Urgent offers, flash sales, limited-time deals | 98% open rate, 36% click rate | $0.01-0.03/msg |
| **Email** | Product launches, newsletters, educational content | 20% open rate, 3% click rate | $0.001/email |
| **Social** | Brand awareness, community building, visual content | Varies by platform | Free (organic) |

<Callout type="tip">
**Multi-channel works best**: Send SMS for urgent promotions, email for details, social for brand building. Drip can coordinate across all three.
