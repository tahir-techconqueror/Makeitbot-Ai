## Generating Your First Vibe

### Method 1: Start from Preset

1. **Choose your vibe type** (Web or Mobile)
2. **Browse preset cards** - Click any preset to see preview
3. **Generate from preset** - Click "Generate" on preset card
4. **AI customizes** - Claude adapts preset to your prompt

**Example:**
- Preset: "Cyberpunk"
- Your input: "Make it more purple, less neon"
- Result: Cyberpunk aesthetic with purple accents, toned-down neon

### Method 2: Describe from Scratch

1. **Choose your vibe type** (Web or Mobile)
2. **Click "Custom Vibe"**
3. **Describe your vision** in natural language
4. **AI generates** - Claude creates theme from scratch

**Good prompts:**
```
"Earthy tones with lots of green, organic vibes,
think farmers market meets dispensary"

"Luxury cannabis experience, gold accents, dark
background, premium feel like a high-end hotel"

"Fun and playful, bright colors, friendly and
approachable for first-time cannabis buyers"
```

**Bad prompts:**
```
"Make it look good" (too vague)
"Blue" (not enough context)
"Like Apple" (too generic)
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Best prompt structure:**
1. Overall mood/aesthetic
2. Color preferences
3. Target audience or brand comparison
4. Any specific elements you want
</Callout>

## Refining Your Vibe

After generation, you can refine the result:

1. **Click "Refine Vibe"** (web vibes only)
2. **Describe changes** - "Make it darker," "Use more blue," "Softer fonts"
3. **AI adjusts** - Claude updates the theme based on your feedback
4. **Iterate** - Keep refining until perfect

**Refinement examples:**
- "Make the primary color lighter"
- "Change fonts to something more modern"
- "Increase border radius for rounder look"
- "Add more contrast between sections"

<Callout type="info">
