        ↓
      Day 10: Final reminder
        ↓
        END (exit playbook)
```

**Setting conditions:**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After: Step 3 (Discount Offer)

## Common Mistakes

✅ 5-step, 7-day playbook (higher completion)

**Mistake 2: No Branching**
❌ Same path for everyone
✅ Different paths based on behavior

**Mistake 3: Generic Content**
❌ "Hi customer, check out our products"
✅ "Hi Sarah, based on your love of Sativas..."

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Data**
❌ Set it and forget it forever
✅ Review monthly, optimize based on data

**Mistake 5: No Exit Strategy**
❌ Keep sending even after purchase
✅ Exit playbook after goal achieved

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Start simple:** First playbook should be 3-5 steps max. Learn what works, then expand.

**Test everything:** A/B test subject lines, send times, offers. Data beats assumptions.

**Personalize:** Use customer name, past purchases, browsing history. Generic = ignored.

**Respect preferences:** Honor unsubscribes, Do Not Disturb, frequency caps. Trust > sales.

**Monitor closely:** First 2 weeks are critical. Watch data daily, optimize quickly.
