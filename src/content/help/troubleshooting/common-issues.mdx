# Common Issues & Solutions

Quick fixes for the most common problems in Markitbot. Most issues can be resolved in minutes!

## Authentication & Login Issues

### Can't Log In

**Problem**: Login page says "Invalid credentials" or "User not found"

**Solutions**:
1. **Reset your password**
   - Click "Forgot Password" on login page
   - Check your email for reset link
   - Create new password and try again

2. **Check your email**
   - Make sure you're using the email you signed up with
   - Check for typos in email address
   - Try both personal and work emails if you have multiple

3. **Clear browser cache**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Clear and try logging in again

4. **Try incognito/private mode**
   - This rules out browser extension conflicts
   - If it works, disable browser extensions one by one to find the culprit

### Stuck on Login Page

**Problem**: Page keeps redirecting back to login even after successful login

**Solutions**:
1. **Enable cookies**
   - Markitbot requires cookies for authentication
   - Check browser settings → Privacy → Allow cookies

2. **Check if third-party cookies are blocked**
   - Some browsers block them by default
   - Add `markitbot.com` to allowed sites

3. **Disable VPN temporarily**
   - Some VPNs interfere with session cookies
   - Try disabling and logging in again

## Product & Catalog Issues

### Products Not Showing Up

**Problem**: Added products but they don't appear on menu or in Ember

**Solutions**:
1. **Check product status**
   - Go to **Dashboard → Products**
   - Verify products are marked "Active"
   - Inactive products won't show publicly

2. **Publish your menu**
   - Go to **Dashboard → Brand Page**
   - Click "Publish Menu"
   - Menu must be published for products to be visible

3. **Wait for sync**
   - If using POS sync, products may take 1-5 minutes to appear
   - Check "Last Sync" timestamp in POS settings
   - Try manual "Sync Now" if it's been > 10 minutes

### Products Showing $0 Price

**Problem**: Products display but show $0.00 or "Price not available"

**Solutions**:
1. **For POS-synced products**:
   - Check that prices are set in your POS system
   - For Alleaves: Verify adult-use OR medical-use prices are set (generic prices often $0)
   - Re-sync: Go to Settings → POS → "Sync Now"

2. **For manual products**:
   - Edit the product
   - Add a price in the "Price" field
   - Save changes

3. **For imported products**:
   - Check your CSV or import source included prices
   - Re-import with correct price data

### Duplicate Products

**Problem**: Same product appearing multiple times in catalog

**Solutions**:
1. **Delete duplicates manually**
   - Go to **Dashboard → Products**
   - Find duplicate products
   - Click ⋯ menu → Delete for extras
   - Keep the one with best data (images, description, etc.)

2. **Check import sources**
   - If using both POS sync AND manual imports, you may create duplicates
   - Pick one source of truth for each product
   - Disable auto-import if managing manually

3. **Use product matching**
   - Go to **Products → Dedupe Tool**
   - Review suggested matches
   - Merge or keep separate as needed

## POS Integration Issues

### POS Sync Failing

**Problem**: "Sync failed" error or products not updating from POS

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify credentials**
   - Go to **Settings → Integrations → POS**
   - Click "Test Connection"
   - If fails, re-enter username/password/API key
   - For Alleaves: Include PIN if required

2. **Check POS system status**
   - Is your POS system online and working?
   - Try logging into POS admin panel separately
   - Contact POS support if their system is down

3. **Review error logs**
   - Go to **Settings → Integrations → POS → Sync Logs**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Common errors and fixes:
     - "Unauthorized": Re-enter credentials
     - "Location not found": Verify Location ID is correct
     - "Timeout": POS system may be slow, try again in 5 minutes

### Products Syncing But Stock is Wrong

**Problem**: Products show in Markitbot but quantities don't match POS

**Solutions**:
1. **Check sync settings**
   - Verify "Sync Inventory" is enabled
   - Check sync frequency (default: every 4 hours)
   - Try manual "Sync Now"

2. **Verify POS has correct stock**
   - Log into your POS admin
   - Check "available" inventory (not just "on hand")
   - Some POS systems separate "total" from "sellable" inventory

3. **Clear and re-sync**
   - Go to Products → "Clear All POS Products"
   - Go to POS Settings → "Full Re-Sync"
   - This rebuilds from scratch (takes 5-10 min)

## Chatbot (Ember) Issues

### Ember Not Responding

**Problem**: Chatbot widget appears but Ember doesn't respond to messages

**Solutions**:
1. **Check chatbot is enabled**
   - Go to **Settings → Chatbot**
   - Verify "Enable Chatbot" is toggled ON
   - Save if you made changes

2. **Refresh the page**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - This clears chatbot cache

3. **Check agent status**
   - Go to **Dashboard → Agents → Ember**
   - Verify status is "Online" (not Training or Paused)
   - If paused, click "Resume"

### Ember Giving Wrong Recommendations

**Problem**: Chatbot recommends products that don't match customer needs

**Solutions**:
1. **Improve product data**
   - Add effects tags (Relaxing, Energizing, etc.)
   - Include strain types (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)
   - Add THC/CBD percentages
   - Write descriptions mentioning use cases

2. **Update featured products**
   - Mark your best products as "Featured"
   - Ember prioritizes these in recommendations
   - Go to Products → Edit → Check "Featured"

3. **Review chatbot training**
   - Go to **Settings → Chatbot → Training**
   - Add examples of good recommendations
   - Ember learns from these patterns

## Performance & Loading Issues

### Dashboard Loading Slowly

**Problem**: Dashboard takes >10 seconds to load or times out

**Solutions**:
1. **Check internet connection**
   - Run a speed test
   - Need at least 5 Mbps for smooth experience
   - Try different network if possible

2. **Clear browser cache**
   - Old cached files can slow things down
   - Clear cache and reload

3. **Reduce data range**
   - If viewing analytics, shorten date range
   - Try "Last 7 Days" instead of "All Time"
   - Large datasets take longer to load

### Images Not Loading

**Problem**: Product images or brand logos not displaying

**Solutions**:
1. **Check image URLs**
   - Go to product/brand edit page
   - Verify image URL is valid
   - Try opening URL in new tab - does it load?

2. **Re-upload images**
   - If using uploaded images, try uploading again
   - Use JPG or PNG (not HEIC or other formats)
   - Keep files under 5MB

3. **Use image hosting**
   - If self-hosting images, ensure your server allows hotlinking
   - Consider using image CDN (Cloudinary, Imgix)
   - Markitbot can host images for you

## Payment & Billing Issues

### Can't Update Payment Method

**Problem**: Card declined or payment method won't save

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify card details**
   - Check expiration date is in future
   - Verify CVV is correct
   - Ensure billing address matches card

2. **Try different card**
   - Some banks block online payments
   - Try debit card if credit fails (or vice versa)
   - Contact your bank to authorize the charge

3. **Check billing email**
   - Look for failed payment notifications
   - May have additional verification steps

### Subscription Issues

**Problem**: Plan shows as expired or features locked

**Solutions**:
1. **Check payment status**
   - Go to **Settings → Billing**
   - See if recent payment failed
   - Update payment method if needed

2. **Contact support**
   - Email: support@markitbot.com
   - Include account email
   - We can manually restore access while resolving payment
