# POS Sync Problems

Detailed troubleshooting for POS integration issues. Most problems can be fixed in under 10 minutes!

## Quick Diagnostic

**Before troubleshooting**, check these basics:
1. ✅ Is your POS system online and working?
2. ✅ Can you log into your POS admin panel?
3. ✅ Are credentials entered correctly in Markitbot?
4. ✅ Does your POS account have API access enabled?

If all yes, continue to specific issues below.

## Sync Status Meanings

| Status | What It Means | Action Needed |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| ✅ Synced | Working perfectly | None |
| 🔄 Syncing | Currently updating | Wait 2-5 minutes |
| ⚠️ Stale | Last sync > 24 hours ago | Click "Sync Now" |
| ❌ Failed | Last sync attempt failed | See troubleshooting below |

## Authentication Errors

### "Invalid Credentials" or "Unauthorized"

**For Alleaves:**
1. Verify you're using correct username (usually email)
2. Check password (try logging into Alleaves admin separately)
3. **Include PIN** if your location requires it
4. Verify Location ID is correct (found in Alleaves settings)
5. Try resetting password in Alleaves, then update in Markitbot

**For Dutchie:**
1. Disconnect and reconnect OAuth
2. Ensure you're authorizing the correct location
3. Check that Dutchie Plus or Order Ahead is active
4. Verify API access is enabled in Dutchie admin

**For Jane:**
1. Generate new API key in Jane admin
2. Copy FULL key (don't truncate)
3. Paste into Markitbot without extra spaces
4. Verify API permissions include "Read Products"

### "API Access Denied"

**Solutions:**
1. Contact your POS support to enable API access
2. Some POS systems require paid tier for API
3. Verify your account role has API permissions (may need admin)
4. Check if IP whitelisting is required (let us know if so)

## Products Not Syncing

### Zero Products Imported

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ At least one product exists in POS marked "active"
2. ✅ Products have valid categories
3. ✅ Location ID is correct (for multi-location)
4. ✅ POS account has permission to view products
5. ✅ API endpoint is responding (check sync logs)

**Try:**
- Sync one location at a time if multi-location
- Check if POS has quantity limits on API calls
- Review error logs in Settings → Integrations → Logs
- Contact support with error message

### Only Some Products Syncing

**Common causes:**
1. **Inactive products**: Only "active" products sync
2. **Category exclusions**: Some categories may be filtered (e.g., "supplies")
3. **Missing data**: Products without names or categories skip
4. **Duplicate detection**: May skip if similar product exists

**Solutions:**
1. In POS, mark missing products as "active"
2. Check Markitbot category mappings in POS settings
3. Ensure all products have name + category in POS
4. Review "Skipped Products" list in sync logs

### Products Syncing But Disappearing

**Causes:**
1. Product marked inactive in POS after sync
2. Out of stock + "Hide sold out" enabled
3. Price dropped to $0 + "Hide free items" enabled
4. Category filter excluding product

**Solutions:**
1. Check product status in POS
2. Adjust "Hide sold out" setting
3. Review product filters in Markitbot settings
4. Check sync logs for deletion events

## Price Issues

### All Prices Showing $0

**For Alleaves** (Most Common):
1. In Alleaves admin, check if prices are set under:
   - **Adult-Use Retail** / **Adult-Use OTD** ← Usually here
   - Medical-Use Retail / Medical-Use OTD
   - Generic Retail / Generic OTD ← Often $0
2. Alleaves prioritizes adult-use prices, then medical, then generic
3. If all are $0, prices aren't set in Alleaves
4. Set prices in Alleaves, then re-sync

**For Other POS Systems:**
1. Verify retail prices are set (not just wholesale/cost)
2. Check if "active pricing" is enabled
3. Ensure product isn't marked "call for price"
4. Review if tax is included (some POS separate tax)

### Some Prices $0, Others Correct

**Causes:**
1. Those products don't have adult-use OR medical prices set
2. Product type doesn't match expected category
3. Regional pricing not configured
4. Price tier mismatch

**Solution:**
1. Find affected products in POS
2. Set adult-use retail and OTD prices
3. Save in POS
4. Re-sync in Markitbot
5. Verify prices appear

### Prices Syncing But Wrong Amounts

**Check:**
1. Are you syncing "Retail" or "OTD" (out-the-door) prices?
   - Markitbot defaults to OTD (includes tax)
   - Configure in POS settings which to use
2. Is tax calculated separately in POS?
3. Are there regional price variations?
4. Membership/loyalty discounts affecting base price?

## Inventory/Stock Issues

### Stock Levels Not Updating

**Solutions:**
1. Verify "Sync Inventory" is enabled in POS settings
2. Check sync frequency (hourly vs daily)
3. In POS, ensure using "available" quantity (not "on hand")
   - "On hand" = total inventory
   - "Available" = sellable inventory
4. Some POS systems separate reserves from available
5. Try manual sync to force refresh

### Stock Shows Negative Numbers

**Causes:**
1. Overselling in POS (sold more than had)
2. Inventory adjustment not synced
3. Multi-location stock aggregation issue

**Solutions:**
1. Correct inventory in POS
2. Re-sync from Markitbot
3. If multi-location, sync each separately
4. Contact POS support if persists

### Out of Stock Products Still Showing

**Settings to check:**
1. "Hide sold out products" in Markitbot settings
2. "Low stock threshold" may be set too low
3. Sync frequency (might not have synced recently)
4. Manual sync to get latest stock

## Sync Frequency Issues

### Sync Running Too Often

**Problem**: Hitting POS API rate limits

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce sync frequency (hourly → every 4 hours)
2. Only sync during business hours
3. Upgrade POS API tier if available
4. Use manual sync only during peak

### Sync Not Running Automatically

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Auto-sync is enabled in POS settings
2. ✅ Sync schedule is configured
3. ✅ No recent authentication errors
4. ✅ POS system has been synced at least once manually

**Try:**
- Toggle auto-sync off, then back on
- Manually sync once to "restart" scheduler
- Check if API limits were exceeded (wait a few hours)

## Performance Issues

### Sync Takes Forever (>30 minutes)

**For large catalogs (500+ products):**
1. First sync always takes longest (10-30 min is normal)
2. Subsequent syncs are incremental (much faster)
3. Reduce sync frequency if hitting timeouts
4. Consider syncing during off-hours

**To speed up:**
1. Exclude categories you don't sell online
2. Sync one location at a time (if multi-location)
3. Filter out inactive/archived products
4. Contact support for bulk import tools

## Data Quality Issues

### Product Names Look Wrong

**Examples:**
- "FLW-BD-3.5" instead of "Blue Dream 3.5g"
- ALL CAPS names
- Missing brand names

**Solutions:**
1. Fix in POS (Markitbot syncs exactly what POS provides)
2. Use "Product Name Format" rules in Markitbot
3. Bulk rename in Products → Bulk Edit
4. Set naming standards in POS going forward

### Categories Mapping Incorrectly

**Example**: "Cartridge" syncing as "Vapes" or "Accessories"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → POS → Category Mapping
2. Map POS categories to Markitbot standard categories:
   - Flower
   - Vapes (includes carts, disposables, pods)
   - Edibles
   - Concentrates
   - Tinctures
   - Topicals
   - Accessories
3. Save and re-sync

### Missing Product Images

**POS systems rarely include images**

**Solutions:**
1. Markitbot uses category placeholder images
2. Manually upload product photos
3. Use AI image generation (coming soon)
4. Link to brand-provided product images

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Sync Logs
1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → POS → Sync Logs**
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Note which products failed
4. Copy error to support ticket if unclear

### Test API Connection
1. Settings → POS → Test Connection
2. Should return "Success" with location info
3. If fails, shows specific error
4. Use this to verify credentials before syncing

### Force Full Re-Sync
1. Go to Products → "Clear POS Products"
2. Confirm (this removes all POS-synced products)
3. Go to POS Settings → "Full Re-Sync"
4. Wait 10-30 minutes for complete rebuild
5. Use this as last resort for corrupted data
