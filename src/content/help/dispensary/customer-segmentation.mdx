# Customer Segmentation

Target the right customers with the right message. Learn how to segment your audience for personalized marketing that drives higher engagement and sales.

## Why Segment Customers?

```
Email: "Check out our products!"
Open rate: 18%
Click rate: 2.1%
Conversion: 0.8%
```

**Segmented (personalized message):**
```
Email: "Sarah, your favorite Sativas are back!"
Open rate: 42%
Click rate: 8.4%
Conversion: 3.2%

4x better results
```

<Callout type="success">
**Real impact:** Segmented campaigns generate 3.2x higher revenue per recipient vs. non-segmented campaigns, with 68% better conversion rates.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Start simple:** Begin with RFM segmentation (auto-generated), then expand to custom segments.

**Test and learn:** A/B test messages to different segments to find what works.

**Don't over-segment:** 5-10 active segments is plenty. Too many becomes unmanageable.

**Keep segments fresh:** Auto-refresh daily so segments stay accurate.

**Combine strategies:** Use RFM + product preference + behavior for precision targeting.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Many Segments**
❌ 30 tiny segments (10 customers each)
✅ 6-8 meaningful segments (100+ customers each)

**Mistake 2: Static Segments**
❌ Create once, never update
✅ Auto-refresh daily, campaigns stay relevant

**Mistake 3: Generic Messages**
❌ Same email to "VIPs" as everyone else
✅ Personalized message referencing segment

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Small Segments**
❌ Only market to large segments
✅ Small high-value segments (Champions) deserve attention

**Mistake 5: No Testing**
❌ Assume segment will respond
✅ A/B test message to validate assumptions
