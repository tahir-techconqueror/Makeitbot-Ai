## Loyalty Program Types

### 1. Points-Based Program

**How it works:**
- Customers earn points on purchases
- Points can be redeemed for discounts
- Simple, easy to understand

**Example:**
```
Earn: 1 point per $1 spent
Redeem: 100 points = $5 off

Customer spends $50 → Earns 50 points
After 2 purchases ($100 total) → 100 points = $5 off
```

**Best for:**
- Most dispensaries (universal appeal)
- Easy to explain
- Flexible rewards

### 2. Tiered Program

**How it works:**
- Customers unlock tiers based on spending
- Each tier offers increasing benefits
- Motivates customers to spend more

**Example:**
```
Bronze (0-$499 lifetime):
- 1 point per $1
- Birthday 10% off

Silver ($500-$999 lifetime):
- 1.5 points per $1
- Birthday 15% off
- Early access to new products

Gold ($1,000+ lifetime):
- 2 points per $1
- Birthday 20% off
- Exclusive products
- Free delivery
```

**Best for:**
- Brands with wide product range
- Encouraging high-value customers
- Creating exclusivity

### 3. Cashback Program

**How it works:**
- Customers earn cashback on purchases
- Cashback automatically applies to next order

**Example:**
```
Earn: 5% cashback on all purchases

Customer spends $100 → Earns $5 cashback
Next purchase: Cashback applied automatically
```

**Best for:**
- Simplicity (customers understand cash)
- No point calculations
- Automatic rewards

### 4. Referral Program

**How it works:**
- Customers refer friends
- Both get rewards when friend makes purchase

**Example:**
```
Refer a friend:
- Friend gets 15% off first purchase
- You get 100 points ($10 value)

Unlimited referrals!
```

**Best for:**
- Acquiring new customers
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- Growing customer base

## Setting Up Your Loyalty Program

### Step 1: Choose Program Type

**Settings → Loyalty → Program Type**

**Select:**
- Points-Based (recommended)
- Tiered
- Cashback
- Hybrid (points + tiers)

### Step 2: Configure Points Earning

**How customers earn points:**

**Purchase-Based:**
```
Base: 1 point per $1 spent
(Most common starting point)

Options:
- 1 point per $1 (standard)
- 2 points per $1 (generous)
- 1 point per $2 (conservative)
```

**Bonus Points:**
```
☑ Double points on birthday
☑ Bonus points for reviews (50 points per review)
☑ Bonus points for referrals (100 points per referral)
☑ Bonus points for social follows (25 points)
☑ First purchase bonus (200 points)
```

**Category Multipliers:**
```
Flower: 1x points
Vapes: 1x points
Edibles: 1.5x points (promote category)
New Products: 2x points (encourage trials)
```

### Step 3: Configure Redemption

**How customers redeem points:**

**Redemption Rate:**
```
100 points = $5 off
(Industry standard: 1 point = $0.05)

Options:
- 100 points = $5 (5% value)
- 100 points = $10 (10% value, more generous)
- 200 points = $10 (5% value, higher threshold)
```

**Minimum Redemption:**
```
Minimum: 100 points
(Prevents small, frequent redemptions)
```

**Maximum Redemption:**
```
Max per order: 50% of order value
(Protects margins)

Example:
$100 order:
- Can redeem up to $50 in points
- Must pay at least $50
```

**Expiration:**
```
☐ Points never expire (recommended)
☑ Points expire after 12 months of inactivity
```
