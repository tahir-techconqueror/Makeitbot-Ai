## Event Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Start small**: First event? Keep it simple. Vendor day or small tasting.

**Over-communicate**: Send multiple reminders. No-show rates are 20-40% even with RSVP.

**Capture data**: Collect emails/phones at check-in for follow-up.

**Make it exclusive**: Limited spots, RSVP required → creates urgency.

**Post about it**: Share photos/videos during and after → builds FOMO for next event.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Little Notice**
❌ Announce event 5 days before
✅ Give 3-6 weeks notice for planning

**Mistake 2: No RSVP**
❌ "Open event, come if you can"
✅ Require RSVP for planning and commitment

**Mistake 3: Poor Follow-Up**
❌ Event ends, no communication
✅ Thank you email next day, survey, exclusive offer

**Mistake 4: No Measurement**
❌ "Event was fun!" but no data
✅ Track attendance, sales, signups, ROI
