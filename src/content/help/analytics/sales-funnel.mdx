# Sales Funnel Analysis

Understand your customer journey from first visit to purchase. Identify bottlenecks, optimize conversion rates, and increase revenue by analyzing your sales funnel.

## What is a Sales Funnel?

A sales funnel tracks the customer journey through stages:

```
1. Awareness (1,000 visitors)
   ↓ 40% continue
2. Interest (400 view products)
   ↓ 30% continue
3. Consideration (120 add to cart)
   ↓ 50% continue
4. Purchase (60 complete order)

Overall Conversion: 6% (60/1,000)
```

**Each stage represents:**
- How many customers enter
- How many continue to next stage
- Where customers drop off
