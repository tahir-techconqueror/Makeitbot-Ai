## Common Dashboard Questions

**Q: Why is today's revenue lower than yesterday?**
A: Could be day-of-week effect (Mondays slower), weather, or random variance. Check weekly/monthly trend instead.

**Q: AOV dropping - is that bad?**
A: Not always. Could mean more small orders (good for volume). Check total revenue trend.

**Q: When should I worry about metrics?**
A: 7-day trends more reliable than single days. 3+ weeks of decline = investigate.

**Q: How do I set realistic goals?**
A: Start with last month's numbers, add 10-15% growth. Adjust based on results.
