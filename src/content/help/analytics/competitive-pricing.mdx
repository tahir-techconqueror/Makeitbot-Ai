## Why Competitive Pricing Matters

**Price yourself right:**

- 🎯 **Stay competitive** - Don't lose sales to cheaper alternatives
- 📊 **Data-driven** - Price based on market, not guesses
- 🔄 **Dynamic optimization** - Adjust prices as market changes
- 🏆 **Win more sales** - Be competitive on key products

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
**Don't race to bottom:** Being cheapest isn't always best. Focus on value, not just price.

**Monitor regularly:** Check competitive pricing weekly. Markets shift quickly.

**Test price changes:** A/B test price increases. Track impact on volume and profit.

**Communicate value:** If charging premium, explain why (quality, service, experience).

**Use dynamic pricing:** Automate price adjustments with Ledger for maximum profit.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Pricing Too Low**
❌ "Let's be cheapest to win customers"
✅ "Let's price competitively and compete on value"

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Market Data**
❌ Set prices based on gut feeling
✅ Use competitive intelligence to inform decisions

**Mistake 3: Static Pricing**
❌ Set prices once, never adjust
✅ Adjust prices based on demand, inventory, competition

**Mistake 4: Reacting Too Quickly**
❌ Competitor drops price → immediately match
✅ Analyze impact, consider alternatives (improve offering)

**Mistake 5: Forgetting Costs**
❌ Lower prices below cost to compete
✅ Maintain healthy margins, compete elsewhere
