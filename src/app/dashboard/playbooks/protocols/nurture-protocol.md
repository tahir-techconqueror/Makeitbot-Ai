# Objective
Systematically process new signups to maximize conversion for the "Claim Pro" and "Empire" plans.

## 1. Triage Logic (Executed by Leo)
All new users must be categorized into one of three tiers:

- **Tier 1 (Whales)**: 
  - **Criteria**: Enterprise email (non-gmail), VP/C-level title, or funding data present.
  - **Action**: Immediate handoff to **Jack** for high-touch outreach.
  
- **Tier 2 (Growers)**:
  - **Criteria**: Dispensary owners, Agency leads, generic business emails.
  - **Action**: Enriched by **Agent-Enricher-01**, then decision based on Funding/Retail count.

- **Tier 3 (Volume)**:
  - **Criteria**: Generic email (gmail/yahoo), no clear business data.
  - **Action**: Automated Nurture Sequence managed by **Drip**.

## 2. Nurture Sequences (Managed by Drip + Mrs. Parker)

### Sequence A: "The Value Add" (Tier 3)
*Goal: Drive user to 'Claim Page' twice.*
- **Day 0**: Welcome + "Claim Your Page" link (Email).
- **Day 2**: "Did you see your competitor?" (Email - via Radar data).
- **Day 5**: 10% Off First Month Coupon (SMS).

### Sequence B: "The Partner Path" (Tier 2)
*Goal: Schedule a Demo.*
- **Day 0**: Personal intro from "Martez" (Automated by Drip).
- **Day 1**: Case Study: "How Essex Apothecary grew 30%".
- **Day 3**: "Free Menu Audit" offer.

## 3. Collaboration Rules
- **Mrs. Parker**: Monitors "Last Login". If > 7 days, trigger "Winback" flow.
- **Drip**: Executes the actual sending of content.
- **Leo**: Reviews weekly conversion stats from these cohorts.
