# 🚀 The Road to Production: A Playbook

This document provides a clear-eyed assessment of the markitbot AI platform's current state. It's a playbook for understanding our strengths, addressing our weaknesses, and preparing for the hard problems that come with launching a real-world, multi-tenant, AI-powered commerce system.

## ✅ The Good: The Hardened Core

This is what we've built right. These architectural choices and recent fixes give us a massive advantage in speed, scalability, and intelligence.

1.  **Live CannMenus Integration**: The entire product catalog, pricing, and retailer data model is now driven by live API calls to CannMenus. The integration is robust, using runtime environment variables for security and proper API versioning.

2.  **Live AI-Powered Search (RAG)**: Our AI Budtender (Ember) is fully functional. It uses a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, performing vector searches against real product data to provide intelligent, semantic recommendations.

3.  **Secure Internal APIs**: Key internal endpoints, like the agent dispatcher, are now secured and can only be accessed by authenticated users with the 'owner' role, preventing unauthorized access and resource consumption.

4.  **Idempotent, Event-Driven Architecture**: Our core event spine is now idempotent. Agents track which events they've processed, preventing duplicate actions (like sending multiple order confirmation emails) even if the dispatcher runs multiple times.

5.  **Robust Error Handling & Dead-Letter Queue**: When an agent fails to process an event, it is now automatically moved to a `events_failed` collection (a Dead-Letter Queue). This prevents a single failing event from blocking the pipeline and ensures no critical business logic is silently lost.

6.  **Unified & Secure Authentication**: The login and onboarding flows are now centralized and secure, correctly routing all new users through the role selection process.

## 🟡 The Bad: Technical Debt Paid

This section previously listed our most significant pre-launch risks. As of now, the following have been resolved:

*   **Insecure Internal APIs**: Addressed by adding 'owner' role-based protection.
*   **Simplistic Agent Dispatching**: Addressed by implementing idempotent event processing with a `processedBy` flag.
*   **No Dead-Letter Queue for Events**: Addressed by moving failed events to an `events_failed` collection.

With these fixes, the most critical backend vulnerabilities have been mitigated, paving the way for a more stable and secure production environment.

## 👹 The Ugly: The Hard Problems & External Realities

These are the issues that are difficult, expensive, or dependent on outside factors. They represent the biggest long-term challenges to the business itself.

1.  **Cannabis Compliance (Sentinel's Real Job)**: This is, without question, the hardest part of the entire business.
    *   **The Issue**: Compliance rules for marketing, sales, and delivery are a patchwork of state-level laws that change constantly. A "giveaway" SMS might be legal in Michigan but illegal in Illinois. Online payment might be allowed in one state but restricted to "reservation-only" in another.
    *   **Production Impact**: A mistake here isn't a bug; it's a potential legal and licensing disaster for our customers. A production-ready compliance agent (`deebo`) requires a dedicated legal data provider and a sophisticated rules engine.

2.  **Payment Processor Risk (CannPay/Smokey Pay)**: The cannabis industry is still high-risk for payment processors.
    *   **The Issue**: Even with "cannabis-friendly" processors, the regulatory landscape is volatile. A processor could change their terms, increase their fees, or shut down with little notice.
    *   **Production Impact**: Our entire retail checkout flow depends on this third-party integration. We have a single point of failure for our customers' revenue stream. A long-term strategy requires having backup processors or an abstraction layer that can switch between them.

3.  **Vector Embedding Drift and "Vibes" Mismatch**: The semantic search feels magical, but it's not deterministic.
    *   **The Issue**: When we update our embedding models, the "meaning" of our vectors can shift. A query that worked perfectly yesterday might return slightly different results today, leading to a perceived drop in recommendation quality that is incredibly hard to debug.
    *   **Production Impact**: This can lead to subtle degradation in the user experience. The roadmap item for "Versioned Embeddings" is the correct, albeit complex, solution to this, allowing for A/B testing and rollbacks.

4.  **Cost of AI at Scale**: Every call to `generateEmbedding` and every `ai.definePrompt` costs money.
    *   **The Issue**: A simple user query in the chatbot can trigger multiple LLM and embedding calls. A batch job to re-embed 10,000 products can be surprisingly expensive.
    *   **Production Impact**: Without careful caching, query optimization, and cost monitoring, our cloud bills could spiral out of control. We must implement aggressive caching for embeddings and summaries and add cost tracking to our logs.
