  // Check if pathname starts with a highly likely brand route pattern (first segment is dynamic brand)
  // Simple heuristic: if it's not one of the above reserved routes, and has at least one segment, check if we are in the [brand] route territory.
  // Actually, simpler logic: The [brand] layout will wrap these pages. 
  // But AppLayout wraps everything. We need to identify if we are on a brand page.
  // Since we don't have access to route params here easily without context, we'll rely on regex or exclusion.
  // Current app structure: /dashboard, /, /pricing, /onboarding, /menu (deprecated?), /[brand]

  // Let's hide it for paths that don't match our "platform" pages if we want a custom header for brands.
  // Alternatively, checking if it is NOT one of the known platform routes.

  // However, we have many other potential routes (account, checkout). 
  // Let's specifically target the brand pages if possible. 
  // Brand pages usually look like /some-brand ...

  // Best approach for now: if we are in a route that SHOULD have the dispensary header, we hide this one.
  // Actually, the request implies updating the menu for dispensaries. 
  // Let's assume all pages under /[brand] should use the new header.
  // We can try to detect if the first segment is not a known system route.
