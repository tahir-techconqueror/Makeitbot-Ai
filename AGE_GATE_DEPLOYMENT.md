# Age Gate with Email Capture - Deployment Summary 🚀

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Feature:** Age verification + email/phone lead capture
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

A **dual-mode age gate system** that turns compliance into growth:

1. **Integrated Mode** - Built into all Markitbot-hosted pages
2. **Standalone Embed** - Drop-in widget for external websites

### Key Differentiator
Unlike typical age gates that just verify and move on, **ours captures email/phone leads with TCPA-compliant consent** at the moment of highest intent.

## 🔧 Architecture

### Client → Server Flow
```
Client Component (age-gate-with-email.tsx)
    ↓
Server Action (verifyAgeForGate)
    ↓
Sentinel Agent (deeboCheckAge)
    ↓
State Rules + Age Calculation
    ↓
Return verification result
    ↓
Client captures lead (if email/phone provided)
    ↓
Server Action (captureEmailLead)
    ↓
Firestore /email_leads
    ↓
Queue Drip jobs (/jobs collection)
```

### State Detection Priority
```
1. Brand primaryState (if set)
    ↓
2. Cloudflare cf-region-code header (fastest)
    ↓
3. IP Geolocation API (ipapi.co)
    ↓
4. Fallback to Illinois
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Demo Shop**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache
   localStorage.removeItem('bakedbot_age_verified')

   # Visit
   http://localhost:3000/demo-shop
   ```

2. **Brand Page**
   ```bash
   localStorage.removeItem('bakedbot_age_verified')
   http://localhost:3000/ecstaticedibles
   ```

3. **Embed Demo**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/embed/demo.html
   ```

### Verify Lead Capture

Check Firestore collections:
- `/email_leads` - Captured leads
- `/jobs` - Drip welcome email/SMS jobs

### Test State Detection

```typescript
// In browser console
const headers = new Headers();
const result = await fetch('/api/age-gate/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    dateOfBirth: '1990-01-15',
    state: 'CA', // Try different states
    email: 'test@example.com',
    emailConsent: true,
    source: 'test'
  })
});
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /email_leads/{leadId} {
  // Server-side only writes
  allow create, update: if false;

  // Role-based reads
  allow read: if isRole('brand') &&
                 (request.auth.token.brandId == resource.data.brandId);
  allow read: if isRole('dispensary') &&
                 (request.auth.token.locationId == resource.data.dispensaryId);
  allow read: if isRole('owner');

  // No client deletes
  allow delete: if false;
}
```

### Compliance Checkboxes
- ✅ **TCPA (SMS):** "I agree to receive promotional texts. Message & data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out."
- ✅ **CAN-SPAM (Email):** "I agree to receive promotional emails. You can unsubscribe anytime."

### Age Verification
- ✅ Server-side only (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ State-specific minimum ages
- ✅ Full audit logging
- ✅ 24-hour cache with expiry

## 💰 Business Value

### "Cheap Funnel Feeder" Strategy

1. **Give age gate to brands for free/cheap**
   - They need compliance anyway
   - Adding lead capture is zero extra cost

2. **They capture leads at highest intent**
   - Visitor is entering their site
   - Already interested in cannabis
   - Perfect time to capture contact

3. **Automated nurture via Drip**
   - Welcome email immediately
   - Welcome SMS if consented
   - Personalized by brand

4. **Shared audience benefit**
   - Brand builds first-party data
   - Markitbot can cross-sell other brands
   - Reduce reliance on paid ads

5. **Competitive differentiator**
   - Most age gates don't capture leads
   - Ours does, with full compliance
   - Clear value prop for brands

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Marketing (Week 3)
1. Add age gate embed to Markitbot marketing site
2. Create sales collateral for brands
3. Pitch as "free funnel feeder" to brands/dispensaries
4. Case study with Ecstatic Edibles

### Enhancements (Future)
1. A/B test different value props
2. Multi-step age gate (age → email on separate screens)
3. Social login integration (Google, Facebook)
4. SMS verification as alternative to DOB
5. Analytics dashboard for conversion rates
