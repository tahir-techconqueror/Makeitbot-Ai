- 10 challenges (Week 1 + Week 2)
- Pilot cohort (5 max participants)

### 2. Enroll Test User
```typescript
import { enrollInCohort } from '@/server/actions/training';

await enrollInCohort(
  'user_uid_here',
  'cohort-pilot-2026-02'
);
```

**Or manually in Firebase Console:**
```
users/{userId}
  role: "intern"

users/{userId}/training/current
  cohortId: "cohort-pilot-2026-02"
  programId: "markitbot-builder-bootcamp-v1"
  currentWeek: 1
  completedChallenges: []
  totalSubmissions: 0
  status: "active"
```

### 3. Test Flow
1. Login as intern
2. Go to `/dashboard/training`

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current MVP
- ❌ No Monaco Editor (using Textarea for now)
- ❌ No server-side code execution (Linus reviews syntax only)
- ❌ No peer review system
- ❌ No certificates yet
- ❌ No Slack integration
- ❌ Week 5-8 content needs creation
- ❌ Analytics dashboard placeholder only

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)
- Monaco Editor with TypeScript intellisense
- Cloud Run sandboxed execution
- Automated test running
- Peer review assignment
- PDF certificate generation
- Slack bot integration
- Advanced analytics
- Leaderboards/gamification

---

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Textarea Instead of Monaco?
**Decision:** Start simple, add complexity later
**Rationale:**
- Faster to implement (hours vs days)
- Lower maintenance overhead
- Still functional for MVP
- Easy to upgrade later

### Why Server-Side Review Before Execution?
**Decision:** Linus reviews code syntax/quality first, execution later
**Rationale:**
- Faster feedback loop (30-60s vs 2-3 min)
- Cheaper (no container spin-up costs)
- More educational (focuses on code quality)
- Execution can be Phase 2 add-on

### Why Rolling Cohorts?
**Decision:** Weekly cohort starts instead of batch enrollment
**Rationale:**
- Continuous onboarding (50/week sustainable)
- Easier resource management
- Better mentor:intern ratio
- Natural peer grouping
