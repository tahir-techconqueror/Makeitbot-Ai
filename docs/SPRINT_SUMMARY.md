## 📞 ESCALATION ITEMS

### CRITICAL - Immediate Decision Required:

1. **Dev 3 Performance Issue**
   - **Problem:** 0% completion rate across 2 sprints
   - **Impact:** Blocking production launch (security audit)
   - **Options:**
     a) Give Dev 3 one final sprint (Sprint 4) to complete work
     b) Reassign security audit to external consultant
     c) Replace Dev 3 with dedicated QA engineer
   - **Recommendation:** Option A with strict accountability. If Sprint 4 incomplete, proceed with Option B.

2. **Dev 4 Availability**
   - **Problem:** 0% completion in Sprint 3
   - **Impact:** CannPay integration untested
   - **Action Needed:** Verify Dev 4 availability for Sprint 4
   - **Fallback:** Reassign integration testing to Dev 1 if unavailable

---

## 🎯 PRODUCTION LAUNCH: ON TRACK ✅

**Current Status:** 88% ready (8.8/10)
**Launch Target:** December 6, 2025
**Confidence:** **HIGH** (assuming Sprint 4 success)

**Key Success Factors:**
1. ✅ Infrastructure 100% ready (Dev 2)
2. ✅ Security 90% ready (needs audit)
3. ✅ Compliance 90% ready (needs legal cert)
4. ⚠️ Testing 65% ready (needs E2E tests, Sprint 4)
5. ⚠️ Integration untested (needs Sprint 4 validation)

**Conclusion:** **Production launch achievable by December 6 if Sprint 4 completes successfully.**
