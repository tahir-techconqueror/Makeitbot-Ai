## Overview

This guide walks through end-to-end testing of the Markitbot headless menu for **Ecstatic Edibles**, our first **hemp e-commerce pilot customer**. Unlike dispensary brands, Ecstatic Edibles operates an **online-only shipping model** - no local pickup, no dispensary locator.

### Key Differences from Dispensary Model
| Feature | Dispensary (Cannabis) | Ecstatic Edibles (Hemp) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Purchase Model | Local Pickup | Online Shipping |
| "Find Near Me" | Visible | **Hidden** |
| Checkout | Dispensary selection | Shipping address |
| Messaging | "Pickup at Dispensary" | "Ships Nationwide" |
| Product Type | Cannabis | Hemp (CBD/Delta-8) |
