npm run dev

# In another terminal, record interactions
kusho record http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Recording Workflow

1. **Browser Opens** - Kusho launches a browser
2. **Interact** - Navigate and use the app as a user would
3. **Close Browser** - Close browser when done to complete recording
4. **Review Script** - Generated Playwright code opens in your editor
5. **Edit if Needed** - Modify the script, then save
6. **Saved** - Test is saved to `kusho-tests/recordings/`

### 4. Generate AI-Enhanced Tests

Extend your recording with AI-generated test variations:

```bash
# Extend latest recording
kusho extend latest

# Or extend specific recording
kusho extend your-test-name
```

### 5. Run Tests

Execute your tests:

```bash
# Run latest test
kusho run latest

# Run with visible browser (for debugging)
kusho run latest --headed

# Run with video recording
kusho run latest --headed --record

# Run original recording (without AI extensions)
kusho run-recording latest
```

## Tips for Markitbot Testing

1. **Start with Simple Flows** - Begin with basic navigation before complex agent interactions
2. **Test Critical Paths** - Focus on onboarding, agent queries, and dashboard actions
3. **Use --headed for Debugging** - Visual browser helps troubleshoot issues
4. **Review Generated Code** - Always review Playwright scripts before extending
5. **Name Tests Descriptively** - Use clear names like `brand-onboarding-flow` or `agent-product-search`
