2. Schedule legal review with cannabis attorney (2-3 days)
3. Provide production credentials to Dev 2:
   - Stripe keys (if using Stripe)
   - Sentry DSN
   - CannPay production credentials

## 📋 WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

1. ❌ **Test coverage** - Dev 3 delivered nothing
2. ❌ **Manual steps** - GCP secrets and Firestore deployment need manual work
3. ❌ **Legal review** - Attorney validation still needed
4. ❌ **Integration incomplete** - Sentinel not yet in checkout flow
