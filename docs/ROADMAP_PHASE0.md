## Ticket: P0-PAY-CANNPAY-INTEGRATION
**Owner:** Dev 1 (Implementation), Dev 2 (Config), Dev 4 (Testing)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (Testing Pending)

### Summary
Implement complete CanPay payment integration with transaction fee support. Webhook signature verification is already complete (P0-SEC-CANNPAY-WEBHOOK ✅), but end-to-end payment flow, UI, and transaction fee mechanism are missing.

### Requirements
1. **Order Flow Options:**
   - **Default:** Send order to dispensary (no payment needed - customer pays on pickup)
   - **Option #1:** CanPay payment processing (cannabis-specific processor)
   - **Option #2:** Stripe payment (fallback for customers without CanPay)
2. **Transaction Fee:** Charge 50 cents per CanPay transaction
3. **Payment Selection UI:** Customer selects payment method during checkout
4. **Integration:** CanPay RemotePay widget integration per API docs

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Payment selection UI in checkout flow (dispensary-direct / CanPay / Stripe)
- [ ] CanPay client library created (`src/lib/payments/cannpay.ts`)
- [ ] `/integrator/authorize` endpoint integration (get intent_id)
- [ ] CanPay widget launches with intent_id in checkout flow
- [ ] JavaScript callback handles payment success/failure
- [ ] Transaction fee (50 cents) added to CanPay transactions
- [ ] Fee displayed to customer in checkout summary
- [ ] Fee tracked in Firestore order document (`order.canpay.fee`)
- [ ] CannPay secrets referenced in `apphosting.yaml`
- [ ] E2E tests for all three payment paths
- [ ] Documentation in `docs/CANNPAY_INTEGRATION.md`

### Files
- `src/lib/payments/cannpay.ts` (to be created - API client)
- `src/app/api/checkout/process-payment/route.ts` (integrate payment selection)
- `src/components/checkout/payment-selection.tsx` (to be created - UI)
- `src/components/checkout/cannpay-widget.tsx` (to be created - widget wrapper)
- `src/app/api/webhooks/cannpay/route.ts` (webhook already done ✅)
- `apphosting.yaml` (add CannPay secret references)
- `docs/CANNPAY_INTEGRATION.md` (to be created)
- `tests/e2e/checkout-cannpay.spec.ts` (to be created)

### Technical Design

#### 1. CanPay Client Library (`src/lib/payments/cannpay.ts`)
```typescript
// Based on CanPay RemotePay Integration Guide v1.4.0-dev
interface CannPayConfig {
  appKey: string;
  apiSecret: string;
  integratorId: string;
  internalVersion: string;
  environment: 'sandbox' | 'live';
}

interface AuthorizePaymentRequest {
  amount: number; // in cents
  deliveryFee?: number; // in cents (our 50 cent transaction fee)
  merchantOrderId?: string; // our internal order ID
  passthrough?: string; // JSON with orderId/organizationId
}

interface AuthorizePaymentResponse {
  intent_id: string;
  widget_url: string;
}

export async function authorizePayment(request: AuthorizePaymentRequest): Promise<AuthorizePaymentResponse>
export async function getTransactionDetails(intentId: string): Promise<CannPayTransaction>
export async function reverseTransaction(intentId: string): Promise<void>
```

#### 2. Payment Selection Flow
```
Checkout Page
  ↓
Payment Selection Component
  ├─→ Option 1: Dispensary Direct (default - no payment needed)
  ├─→ Option 2: CanPay (+$0.50 transaction fee)
  └─→ Option 3: Stripe (optional fallback)
  ↓
If CanPay selected:
  ↓
Backend: POST /api/checkout/cannpay/authorize
  ↓ (calls CannPay /integrator/authorize)
Returns: { intent_id, widget_url }
  ↓
Frontend: Launch CanPay widget with intent_id
  ↓
Widget Callback: { status, transaction_number, amount }
  ↓
Frontend: POST /api/checkout/process-payment
  ↓
Backend: Verify webhook received (optional)
  ↓
Order status updated: 'paid' or 'failed'
```

#### 3. Transaction Fee Structure
- Base order total: $100.00
- CanPay transaction fee: $0.50
- **Customer pays:** $100.50
- **Dispensary receives:** $100.00
- **Platform fee:** $0.50 (tracked in `order.canpay.fee`)

#### 4. Database Schema Addition
```typescript
// In Firestore orders collection
interface Order {
  // ... existing fields
  paymentMethod: 'dispensary_direct' | 'cannpay' | 'stripe';
  canpay?: {
    intentId: string;
    transactionNumber: string;
    amount: number; // total paid by customer (including fee)
    fee: number; // platform transaction fee (50 cents)
    tipAmount?: number;
    deliveryFee?: number;
    status: 'Success' | 'Settled' | 'Failed' | 'Voided' | 'Pending';
  };
}
```

  - File exists at src/app/api/webhooks/cannpay/route.ts (108 lines)
  - Line 19 has TODO comment for signature verification
  - Reads x-cannpay-signature header (line 13) but does NOT verify it
  - Has CANPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var check but only warns if missing
  - Currently processes ALL webhooks without verification (CRITICAL SECURITY RISK)
  - Uses console.log/console.error - needs structured logging
  - No crypto imports - will need Node.js crypto module for HMAC-SHA256
  - CANPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET missing from apphosting.yaml
  - No logger utility exists (blocked by P0-MON-LOGGING)
  - Next: Research CannPay webhook signature spec, implement verification
- [Dev2-Infra @ 2025-11-29]: ✅ Infrastructure ready. Added CannPay config to apphosting.yaml. Documented sandbox credentials (8954cd15). MANUAL: Create 4 secrets in GCP Console. Ready for Dev1 webhook implementation.
- [Dev1-Claude @ 2025-11-29]: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE. Signature verification implemented:
  - Added verifySignature() function using HMAC-SHA256 with timingSafeEqual for constant-time comparison
  - Now expects { response: "<JSON>", signature: "<HMAC>" } payload per CannPay spec
  - Fails fast with 500 if CANPAY_API_SECRET not configured (production safety)
  - Returns 403 Forbidden for invalid signatures (security logged)

- Brand dashboard shows: analytics, products, orders, agents
- Dispensary dashboard shows: incoming orders, inventory sync, settings
- Customer dashboard shows: order history, saved addresses, favorite dispensary
- All dashboard widgets load real data (not placeholder)
- Dashboard routing works for all roles
- Analytics charts display correctly with real/demo data
- Agent cards link to working agent interfaces
- Permission checks prevent role cross-access (brand can't see dispensary dashboard)

### Files
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (main dashboard - role-based)
- `src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/products/page.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx`

## Ticket: P0-SEC-RBAC-SERVER
**Owner:** Dev 1 (Implementation), Dev 3 (Tests)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** ✅ DONE

### Summary
Add server-side role-based authorization. Currently auth checks only happen client-side and can be bypassed.

### Files
- `src/middleware/require-role.ts` (created - comprehensive alternative middleware)
- `src/app/api/dispensary/orders/route.ts` (enhanced)
- `src/app/api/dispensary/orders/[orderId]/status/route.ts` (enhanced)
- `src/app/api/analytics/forecast/route.ts` (enhanced)
- `src/app/api/inventory/forecast/route.ts` (enhanced)

### AI Log
- [Dev1-Claude @ 2025-11-29]: Server-side auth essential before launch.
- [Dev1-Claude @ 2025-11-29]: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE. Server-side RBAC enforcement:
  - Discovered existing comprehensive RBAC system at `src/server/auth/rbac.ts` and `src/server/auth/auth-helpers.ts`
  - Created alternative middleware at `src/middleware/require-role.ts` (240 lines) with Firebase token verification
  - Enhanced 4 API routes with server-side role validation using existing auth helpers:
    - Dispensary orders routes: Now require 'dispensary' or 'owner' role
    - Analytics/Inventory forecasts: Now require 'brand' or 'owner' role + brand access validation
    - Order status updates: Added order-level authorization using `canAccessOrder()`
  - All routes now use `getUserFromRequest()` instead of manual token verification
  - Structured logging with `[P0-SEC-RBAC-API]` prefix for all auth failures
  - Returns 401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid tokens
  - Returns 403 Forbidden for insufficient role permissions
  - TypeScript compilation passes (npx tsc --noEmit)
  - Committed as 160cb4a0
  - NEXT: Dev 3 should add authorization tests for all protected routes
  - NEXT: Apply same pattern to remaining dashboard/admin API routes if needed
