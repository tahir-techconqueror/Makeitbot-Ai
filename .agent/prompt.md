# Security Audit Session - Q1 2026

## Session Context
**Date:** 2026-01-22/23
**Scope:** OWASP LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection Remediation
**Status:** Complete

---

## Audit Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed addressing prompt injection vulnerabilities based on OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 guidelines. All 9 identified vulnerabilities have been remediated.

### Vulnerabilities Addressed

| ID | Severity | Description | File(s) |
|----|----------|-------------|---------|
| CRIT-1 | Critical | System-initiated validation bypass | `actions.ts` |
| CRIT-2 | Critical | Unsanitized web-scraped content | `scraper-agent.ts`, `analyzer-agent.ts` |
| CRIT-3 | Critical | Shell injection gaps (newline, $IFS, unicode) | `linus.ts` |
| HIGH-1 | High | Admin role reduced risk scoring | `prompt-guard.ts` |
| HIGH-2 | High | Missing output validation | `chat/route.ts`, `agent-runner.ts` |
| MED-2 | Medium | Canary tokens not deployed | `harness.ts` |
| MED-3 | Medium | Ground truth QA injection risk | `dynamic-loader.ts` |
| MED-4 | Medium | Outdated jailbreak patterns | `prompt-guard.ts` |

## Key Changes

### Input Validation (CRIT-1)
- Removed bypass for system-initiated requests
- All inputs now validated regardless of source
- Higher length limits for system sources (5000 vs 2000 chars)

### Web Scraping Sanitization (CRIT-2)
- Added `sanitizeForPrompt()` to Radar pipeline
- Competitor names, product data, and raw markdown sanitized
- Prevents injection via malicious competitor websites

### Shell Injection Patterns (CRIT-3)
Added to `BLOCKED_COMMANDS` in `linus.ts`:
- Newline injection: `\\n`, `%0a`, `&#10;`
- $IFS word splitting: `$IFS`, `${IFS}`, `IFS=`
- Unicode homoglyphs: Full-width characters (U+FF00-U+FFEF)
- Null byte injection: `\\x00`, `%00`
- Here-doc injection: `<<<`, `<<`

### Admin Scoring Equalization (HIGH-1)
- Removed 3x lower risk scoring for admin role
- All roles now have equal validation strictness
- Prevents privilege escalation via compromised admin accounts

### Output Validation (HIGH-2)
- Added `validateOutput()` to chat route and agent-runner
- Detects system prompt leakage, credential exposure
- Sanitizes unsafe content before returning to users

### Canary Tokens (MED-2)
- Deployed in `harness.ts` via `embedCanaryToken()`
- Detects prompt extraction attempts
- Logs security alerts on canary leakage

### Ground Truth Sanitization (MED-3)
- QA pairs from Firestore now sanitized
- `question`, `ideal_answer`, and `context` fields validated
- Prevents brand-provided injection payloads

### 2025 Jailbreak Patterns (MED-4)
Added to `CRITICAL_INJECTION_PATTERNS`:
- HILL attack framework
- FuzzyAI techniques
- Multi-turn jailbreak
- Token smuggling
- Prompt leaking
- Context window overflow
- Instruction hierarchy attacks
