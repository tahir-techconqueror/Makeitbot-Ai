# Agent Reference Files

Detailed documentation for AI agents working in this codebase.

**Rule:** Load refs on-demand. Don't load everything at once — conserve context.

## Loading Strategy

### Always Start With
1. `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded)
2. `.agent/prime.md` (read at session start)

### Load On Demand
Only load specific refs when you're about to work in that area.

### Don't Load
- Multiple refs at once (wastes context)
- Refs for areas you won't touch this session
- Everything "just in case"

---

## Keeping Refs Updated

After significant changes to a subsystem:
1. Update the relevant ref file
2. Include: current state, key files, patterns
3. Note any breaking changes or migrations
4. Cross-reference related docs
